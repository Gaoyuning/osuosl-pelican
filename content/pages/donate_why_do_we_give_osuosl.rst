Why Do We Give To The OSUOSL?
-----------------------------

The OSL collaborates with people and companies around the world. As a
result, the lab has active supporters that range from corporate giants
to individuals who love open source.

Our partnership with Google has resulted in contributions totaling
$1.9 million since 2005. This confidence in the lab’s potential as an
investment in the future of open source has helped us expand our
impact and improve our hosting and development services using new,
collaborative strategies. Below are words from Google’s Chris DiBona
and two of our other supporters on why they are excited about the
opportunity to contribute to the OSL’s mission.

Chris DiBona Google Director of Open Source *“Oregon State’s Open
Source Lab provides world-class services that enable collaboration
among millions of users globally. Google is proud to continue its
support of such an innovative program.”*

Angela Byron ("webchick") Acquia Director, Community Development *"The
OSU Open Source Lab has been instrumental in the growth and stability
of drupal.org, the official website and development collaboration hub
for the Drupal content management platform. When we outgrew our old
hosting back in 2005, OSL graciously stepped in to provide us with
top-notch hosting facilities and skilled systems administrators,
always willing to share their knowledge and expertise. OSL has kept
our home stable and running smoothly to this very day, despite our
community exploding to almost triple its size since when we began our
relationship, and increased system requirements from our development
activity. I'm extremely proud to donate to the OSL to support the
amazing work they do, not just in hosting and supporting the
infrastructure for Drupal, but for many other key open source projects
and communities. Rock on!"*

John Hawley ("Warthog9") Red Hat Senior Software Engineer *"I donate
to OSUOSL because they provide one of the most important services the
open source community can have: hosting. It's great that our code is
Free (as in speech), but hosting is Free (as in beer). I give to make
sure that our future is secure and that they don't turn my boxes off
by mistake."* [Ed. note: We would never do that!]
