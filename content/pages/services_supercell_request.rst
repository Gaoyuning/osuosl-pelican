Supercell Feedback Form
-----------------------
Submitted by Lance Albertson on April 5, 2013


Please provide feedback about how your open source project would use
Supercell.
Name * Email Address * Project * Join the announcement mailing list? *
yes What open source projects are you affiliated with? What is your
role in these projects? (e.g. committer for Foo, occassional
contributor for Bar): Which of these projects would you want to use
Supercell? How are you currently handling your needs for on-demand
virtualization and continuous integration services? If you currently
pay for services that provide you with on-demand virtualization, etc.,
(e.g. Amazon's EC2 cluster, Linode, etc.), would you like to share how
much this costs your project? If you use a paid service, which
features do you use the most? Which features do you love? Which ones
make you miserable? Why?
