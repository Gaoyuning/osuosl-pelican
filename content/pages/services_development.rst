Development
-----------



The Oregon State University Open Source Lab's talented development
staff and student employees develop tools that help projects work more
efficiently and offer open source solutions to meet the needs of
organizations on the community, state and global levels.


Development Projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our development solutions have served many open source projects as
well as educational and government organizations looking to implement
or extend open source software to meet their needs. Here are a few
recent projects the OSL has worked on:


`Ganeti Web Manager`_
`````````````````````

Ganeti Web Manager (GWM) is a Web application developed at the OSL
that allows administrators and clients access to administer and use
Google’s open source cloud infrastructure. With a caching system
designed to scale to many thousands of virtual machines without
decreasing performance, GWM makes private cluster management for
administrators truly simple.


`Oregon Virtual School District`_
`````````````````````````````````

The Oregon Virtual School District is a program led by the Oregon
Department of Education that, in cooperation with a consortium of
virtual learning providers throughout the state, seeks to increase
access and availability of online learning and teaching resources free
of charge to the people of Oregon. Oregon State University is
providing hosting and development resources for the project.


`Protein Geometry Database`_
````````````````````````````

The Protein Geometry Database (PGD) was developed by the OSU Open
Source Lab for use by researchers in OSU's biochemistry department.
PGD provides an online search tool used to mine protein conformational
space with a user-friendly but surprisingly flexible graphical
interface.


`Trisano`_
``````````

TriSano™ is an open source, citizen-focused surveillance and outbreak
management system for infectious disease, environmental hazards and
bioterrorism attacks. It allows local, state and federal entities to
track, control and ultimately prevent illness and death. OSL students
have done development on the Trisano project while working closely
with the project's development team.


`One Laptop Per Child`_
```````````````````````

OSL development staff have worked on multiple aspects of the One
Laptop Per Child (OLPC) and Sugar projects. Two of the larger projects
the OSL has worked on in relation to the OLPC are the media player and
printing support. Collaboration and interaction are a huge focus for
the OLPC project, which seeks to provide inexpensive laptops to
children in developing countries around the world. Because the laptops
are able to record video with a built-in webcam, there was need for a
media player. In partnership with Real, the Open Source Lab offered to
take on this project. The software to fill this void is the media
player activity for Sugar, the user environment for the OLPC project.
The activity is a full-fledged media player, tailored specifically to
fit within the human interface guidelines that the Sugar team has
provided. The media player was created using Python bindings for the
Helix DNA Client. It has been designed to provide the best media
experience possible while maintaining a level of simplicity that
children all around the world will be able to handle.


`Pydra`_
````````

Pydra is a distributed and parallel computing framework for Python.
Pydra aims to provide an easy-to-use framework for writing and running
distributed programs for developers, and an easy-to-manage cluster for
the administrators.


Project Funding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The majority of our development projects are funded through donations
we receive from both the `OSL Alliance`_ and the `Friends of the OSL`_
programs. In certain cases, we have an agreement in place and charge
for our development services. This is especially true for educational
institutions and state and local government agencies looking for help
developing open source software.
