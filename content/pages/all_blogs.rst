`Coming Soon: Beaver BarCamp 15`_
---------------------------------
  Submitted by Rachel Turner on April 1, 2015 ` `_ Spring is almost
  here, and that means Beaver BarCamp 15 is quickly approaching. The
  OSL's annual unconference is scheduled for Saturday, April 18th.
  Participants are beginning to gather ideas and information for their
  sessions, and the Open Source Lab is offering up some helpful
  suggestions on how to present a successful unconference session: 1.
  Plan ahead. While the spirit of BarCamp is spontaneous and
  unstructured, it is a good idea to gather enough information ahead of
  time to present a well-informed BarCamp presentation. Planning for
  your session can help you budget your time and make you less nervous.
  2. Interactivity. One of the reasons unconferences can be valuable is
  the possibility of collaborative and interactive sessions. A formal
  lecture can be restrictive, and can discourage active learning.
  Include the audience in your sessions. Ask them questions in order to
  gauge their experience level. Engage the audience in activities and
  demonstrations. This can lead to a more beneficial session for
  everyone. 3. Angle. It’s always a good idea to establish a position,
  or an angle, on a session topic. It increases opportunity for
  conversation, and gives a good foundation for formatting a session.
  However, it is important to be ready for others to disagree with your
  position, and be prepared to listen to their point of view. Avoid
  getting too defensive about your position on the topic. 4. Visual aids
  help. Visual aids, whether it is a slideshow, a demonstration or
  simply an image, are good tools to illustrate your presentation and
  increase audience interest. It also serves as a discussion point if
  you get lost or stuck during your session. Be sure to test your visual
  aids ahead of time in order to make sure everything is saved and
  working properly. 5. Don't be afraid of a smaller session. While
  popular sessions can be satisfying, smaller sessions allow for more
  discussion and exchanging of ideas. Having a small session does not
  mean you are unsuccessful! 6. Diversity. Beaver BarCamp sessions do
  not have to be tech-based, and attendees are encouraged to present a
  wide variety of session topics. Some examples of past topics include
  Python programming, Zumba, Heartbleed, helicopters and Magic: The
  Gathering. The diverse session topics add to the unconference, and
  presenters should run sessions about what interests them, making for a
  more interesting and better presented talk. Beaver BarCamp is free and
  open to students and community members alike. To learn more about

`SCALE x13`_
------------
  Submitted by Anonymous on March 24, 2015 by Elijah Voigt ` `_ A few
  months ago, Emily Dunham and I were chatting about the talks we had
  recently presented at the Seattle GNU/Linux conference, and the topic
  of other conferences and events we were interested in speaking at came
  up. She pointed me to the Southern California Annual Linux Expo
  (SCALE) and encouraged me to submit one of my talks. Two hours later,
  I had successfully submitted a proposal to give a talk about the media
  suite *Blender 3D* and promptly forgot about the whole thing. A few
  weeks later I got an email congratulating me on being accepted as a
  speaker to Scale x13; a few weeks after that I was on a plane to LA
  getting ready for an eventful (and exhausting) weekend. My talk on
  Blender went well: the room was full, the audience asked amazing
  questions and nobody noticed that I had rewritten most of it the night
  before.* Lance’s talk on Packer was informative and peaked a lot of
  people’s interest. Emily’s talk on Human Hacking in Open Source,
  delivered in the main conference room, was creative, useful and
  amassed an engaged audience. In addition to seeing talks on
  containers, the Maker Movement, containers, DevOps, and containers, I
  spent most of Friday perusing the Expo Hall. I met up and talked with
  organizations we help host like Drupal, the Linux Foundation, and
  Gentoo Linux. I also got to meet developers, community members, and
  representatives from Cylon.js, Chef, the EFF, Elementary OS, Gobot,
  Kids on Computers, Mozilla, NixOS, O’Reilly, Salt Stack, and many
  more. I was humbled and honored to meet leaders and developers of
  projects which I use and love every day. Rather than hosting a booth
  at the event, we opted for a more novel approach to community
  engagement by designing and sharing OSL Trading Cards for our game
  *“Gotta Catch Them All”*. This was hugely popular and by the second
  and third day of our presence at the conference we had people coming
  up to us asking for our “card”-- and they didn’t mean our business
  cards. Scale was an unforgettable event and I hope everybody in the
  FOSS community gets the chance to experience it. *This is an industry
  standard of course, I was just following best practice for conference
  talk-preparation. Links:Scale: `

`A Successful DevOps DayCamp`_
------------------------------
  Submitted by Rachel Turner on November 6, 2014 ` `_ Over 100 students
  and community members attended the Open Source Lab’s DevOps DayCamp in
  the Kelley Engineering Center at Oregon State University on Saturday,
  Oct. 11.DevOps DayCamp, a new event this year, was the kick-off for
  DevOps BootCamp, an extracurricular training program in its second
  year that takes place throughout the school year for OSU students and
  community members interested in DevOps. DayCamp is a dual-track event
  designed to accommodate varying levels of DevOps experience. Tracks
  consisted of a beginner track and an advanced track, with one joint
  session for all experience levels.The beginner track guided less
  experienced attendees in getting started through introductory and
  workshop sessions on the basics of DevOps. Led by the OSL staff,
  beginner attendees received instruction on some basic tools of DevOps,
  including Linux, the terminal and IRC. The sessions set beginners up
  for a successful DevOps BootCamp experience.Computer science student
  Anna Murphy, a beginner, says, “It was pretty intense, but as fast as
  it went it was still manageable. At the end of the day I was amazed by
  how much I had managed to learn. I kept thinking that I wish they had
  told me this in one of my classes.”Advanced track sessions covered
  tools useful in DevOps. Talks were given by industry professionals,
  and included Ansible, Travis CI and Docker. Sessions were lecture-
  based, but also provided time to workshop and gain hands-on
  experience.OSL system administrator Daniel Takamori delivered a
  presentation on Docker in the advanced track. “It was great fun and I
  would love to do it again. The two sides of tracks were great. The
  wide variety of experience was neat to interact with.”Nike presented a
  joint session talk about how DevOps is used in a corporate setting.
  The joint session covered topics including DevOps culture, continuous
  integration and deployment, cloud architecture, cloud security and
  what DevOps is like within Nike.Murphy felt it was a valuable
  experience to extend her education. “It felt like I had a better
  understanding of what tools were used in the industry and how to
  access them,” Murphy says.DevOps BootCamp takes place on Mondays from
  7-9pm in the Kelley Engineering Center. Check out the `website`_ for

`Using Variables in a Custom Drupal Theme`_
-------------------------------------------
  Submitted by lucyw on October 1, 2014 ` `_ At the Open Source Lab we
  host many of our sites as a Drupal multisite. This means that we have
  several instances of Drupal using the same theme, and then we can
  populate each site with different content as needed (for instance,
  cass.oregonstate.edu and osuosl.org would be different websites with
  different messages, but with Drupal they can look and act the same.
  Pretty neat!). Since not all of our sites are used by the OSL (i.e.
  the Center for Applied Systems and Software), I recently needed to
  make our logo and organization name into variables so that the user
  could just upload an image and fill in a text box to customize the
  site theme to their organization. Luckily, Drupal makes my job pretty
  easy. First, I created a file osuosl-setting.php . Since our theme is
  titled osuosl, there are some things I can hard-code under our company
  name and this seemed like one of them. The first step to magic
  variabilization is to alter the systems theme settings and the form
  that controls them. Drupal’s naming scheme is a little wonky (as you
  end up with things like hook_field_attach_prepare_translation_alter()
  ), but in a roundabout way it makes sense. To digress a bit into this
  topic, let’s break down the osuosl_form_system_theme_settings_alter
  name. The first part of Drupal’s function names is the object that it
  is affecting. In this case, osuosl is the name of our theme, and the
  theme is the thing we are trying to add something to (you could also
  be trying to make changes to blocks, pages, hooks, and a variety of
  other things). Then, within the theme we are modifying the form_system
  . This includes any forms that are default in the Drupal theme, such
  as the settings form found under Appearance->Theme->Settings. Next, as
  seen in the previous example, we’re modifying the theme settings form.
  And finally, we are altering the form (as opposed to creating it,
  deleting it or setting variables within it). This is how we get to
  osuosl_form_system_theme_settings_alter . It’s not intuitive, but
  Drupal has excellent documentation to help you along. Now, on to some
  code! `<?php function osuosl_form_system_theme_settings_alter(&$form,
  $form_state){ } ?>` Next, there are two variables that need to be
  added to the form. For each of these, we need to add them to the
  theme_settings array, and then make them into their own arrays to
  store all the necessary information about them. `<?php function
  osuosl_form_system_theme_settings_alter(&$form, $form_state){
  $form['theme_settings']['logo'] = array();
  $form['theme_settings']['site_name'] = array(); } ?>` Now we’ll fill
  in some variables about the logo and name `<?php function
  osuosl_form_system_theme_settings_alter(&$form, $form_state){
  $form['theme_settings']['logo'] = array( '#type' => 'managed_file',
  '#title' => t('logo'), '#required' => TRUE, '#default_value' =>
  theme_get_setting('logo'), '#upload_validators' => array(
  'file_validate_extensions' => array('git png jpg jpeg') ) );
  $form['theme_settings']['site_name'] = array( '#type' => 'textfield',
  '#title' => t('site_name'), '#default_value' =>
  theme_get_setting('site_name') 'required' => TRUE, ); } ?>` Now that
  osuosl-settings.php was done and my variables were ready to be put
  into the theme, I needed to add some defaults for them so that if the
  user didn’t upload a logo or org name, there would still be something
  there. I decided to use the OSL logo and organization name under the
  assumption that the theme will be used primarily by us. So in
  osuosl.info , I added the lines: `settings[logo] = images/logo-
  full.png settings[site_name] = OSU Open Source Lab` Finally, I had to
  call my variables in the Drupal templates so that they would be
  rendered when the site was built! ` <a href="/"><img src="<?php print
  theme_get_setting('logo'); ?>" alt="<?php print
  (theme_get_setting('site_name'));?>" /></a> ` Ta-da! Now, all the user
  has to do is go to Appearances->Theme->Settings to upload a new logo
  and fill in their organization name! Category: `Tech Blog`_

`My Experiences with Openstack`_
--------------------------------
  Submitted by Rachel Turner on September 16, 2014 ` `_ In the simplest
  of terms, `OpenStack`_ is a massive undertaking. The goal of OpenStack
  is to fit just about every use case imaginable. This goal brings with
  it a daunting list of configuration options and requires a larger
  understanding of networking and virtualization systems. Couple that
  with cryptic error messages, and this makes for a system that can
  easily crush a newbie's confidence and cause them to scrap the system
  altogether. Luckily, there are some projects out there trying to lower
  the entry bar and get more people introduced to OpenStack. Two of the
  projects most referred to are `DevStack`_ (which the OpenStack
  developers actually use for development and testing) and `RDO
  Packstack from RedHat`_. Last summer, I began teaching myself
  OpenStack using Packstack. This creates a Proof-Of-Concept (POC)
  deployment suitable to get comfortable with the architecture, the
  concepts and even some architectural design choices. Fast forward a
  few months and, having gathered a much larger (and yet still very
  small) understanding of how OpenStack works, the OSL deployed the POC
  Packstack setup and had our Systems Admins deploying VMs to develop
  and test our Chef cookbooks. Next comes the most daunting challenge:
  configuration management. Configuration management requires a much
  greater understanding of the underlying system because you have to
  know which options should be changed and which options should not. The
  problem with OpenStack in configuration management is that there are
  so many options to set/change in each OpenStack service. The other
  challenge is knowing how to choose the best option for your use case.
  You can create your own management scripts or you can look into the
  various other methods being developed (such as RedHat's RDO Foreman
  using Puppet or Chef's Stackforge). I first started with RDO Foreman
  mostly due to the RDO support community. This community is filled with
  helpful and knowledgeable people who are working on the configuration
  management scripts. Ultimately, however, we went with Stackforge over
  RDO Foreman, mainly because the latter lacked some flexibility we
  required. It also turned out that the Stackforge project would allow
  for us to run multiple environments as well as allowing us to run
  OpenStack on IBM Power CPUs. After a lot of testing, tweaking,
  frustration (head-desking, face palming, cursing), moments of
  inspiration, sudden realizations, and wonderful moments of clarity, we
  had a working test environment. Next, we had to reconcile the
  differences between the testing environment and the production
  environment (as well as throwing in things like changing from
  OpenStack's Havana release to Icehouse for good measure). Currently,
  we are finishing up some testing of our x86 production OpenStack
  cluster and we even have a production OpenPower OpenStack cluster.
  Overall, this project has been an incredible opportunity that enabled
  me to experience different roles in project management, build
  connections in the various OpenStack community, learn more about the
  underlying systems that OpenStack uses (kvm, networking in too much
  detail, web servers, etc.), and, most of all, drastically increase my
  abilities to debug problems with little information while being
  persistent in learning how to properly fix those bugs. Ultimately the
  skills and concepts developed while working with OpenStack can be
  transferred to almost any setting, making it a valuable teaching tool.

`DevOps DayCamp`_
-----------------
  Submitted by Rachel Turner on September 15, 2014 ` `_ The Open Source
  Lab will host the new DevOps DayCamp on Saturday, October 11, in the
  Kelley Engineering Center from 9 a.m. until 6 p.m. The event is free
  and open to the public. DevOps DayCamp will kick off DevOps BootCamp,
  allowing students to start their DevOps education early in the school
  year. In order to accommodate different experience levels, DayCamp is
  comprised of two tracks: a beginner track and an advanced track. The
  beginner track will help inexperienced attendees get started with
  DevOps through introductory sessions and workshops on the basics of
  DevOps. Additionally, the advanced track will be comprised of a hands-
  on hackathon with educational sessions throughout the day for the more
  experienced DevOps crowd. Advanced track sessions will be given by
  industry professionals and will include Ansible, Travis CI and
  Docker.The OSL is hosting DevOps DayCamp instead of the fall `Beaver
  Barcamp`_. Due to the tight academic calendar, as well as the amount
  of organizing a successful Barcamp entails, Beaver Barcamp is now an
  annual event held in the Spring.“This year we decided that it was best
  to switch to a once a year format and focus on making Beaver Barcamp
  better," says Lance Albertson, director of the Open Source Lab. “We
  also look forward to developing new education programs such as a
  hackathon focused on DevOps and FOSS (Free and Open Source Software),
  getting students interested in it early on in their school
  year.”Registration and more information about DevOps DayCamp is
  available on the `website`_.

`Make Bash, Not War`_
---------------------
  Submitted by Rachel Turner on August 4, 2014 ` `_ At the OSL we have
  shared workstations, most of which are named after colors. In the NOC,
  I usually work at emerald.workstation.osuosl.bak (Figure 1). I use
  `tmux`_ (Figure *) to multiplex so I can have multiple terminals open
  in a single ssh connection and connect to my session from anywhere.
  When splitting the terminal vertically, the prompt can get so long
  that it's hard to see the command that I'm entering (Figure 2). I'd
  like my prompt to automatically shorten itself in narrow windows.
  Fortunately, my terminal already knows how much space it has
  available: $COLUMNS is an environment variable which stores how wide
  your current terminal is, and the default unixism is 80. So in order
  to save space, I'd like to shorten my prompt to only a directory
  listing and a colored character replacing the normal $ or >. Behold!
  (Figure 3, 4) Using a case statement and filtering out the name of the
  workstation from the domain name, I can color code my prompt based on
  hostname. This very easily lets me know $HOSTNAME (again, this is an
  environment variable which contains /etc/hostname), and indirectly
  /usr/bin/whoami since almost every other user will preface their
  prompt with a $USER. This was a 10 minute exercise in learning how to
  write case statements in bash and provide some cute utility to an
  otherwise stale prompt. The other thing you might notice is that I
  directly add the unicode heart into the prompt. This causes difficulty
  on TTYs and some terminal emulators where it is replaced with a ♦
  (which is an ASCII character). There should be a check to make sure it
  can be loaded and replaced with something else if it fails. All in
  all, this is just quick hack to make life prettier! `Source!`_

`A Recap of OSCON 2014`_
------------------------
  Submitted by Rachel Turner on July 31, 2014 ` `_ The OSL made a strong
  showing at the `O’Reilly Open Source Conference`_ (OSCON) this year
  with the majority of the student employees attending along with all of
  the full time staff. The conference was held in Portland, OR, and fell
  on July 20-24.The Lab always places a special emphasis on education,
  and the conference was certainly an educational experience. The expo
  hall held dozens of booths filled with information and demonstrations
  about open source projects and the companies that support them. The
  expo hall was student developer Evan Tschuy’s favorite part of the
  conference. “I liked wandering around the expo hall because there were
  so many booths. It was like ‘I’ve heard of that company! Them too!
  I’ve never heard of them, what are they about?’”In between shifts at
  the OSL booth, staff that attended the conference were given the
  opportunity to go to a variety of informational sessions including A
  Glimpse of Git’s future, Data Structures and Netflix API: Top 10
  Lessons Learned. The OSL’s Lucy Wyman attended sessions on graph
  theory and data structures. “They were both given by the same guy, Tim
  Berglund, and he was amazing. When someone asked a question, he always
  knew the answer. It’s nice that he knew more than just his talk; he
  knew the subject really well.”Presenting a session can be just as
  educational as attending a session, and OSL director Lance Albertson
  and student Emily Dunham ran a session on DevOps for University
  Students, discussing `DevOps Bootcamp`_. Another important benefit to
  OSCON is the opportunity for the OSL students to network within the
  open source community. Student systems administrator Daniel Takamori
  says, “I really enjoyed networking with people and seeing how they use
  different open source tools.” In addition to attending sessions, OSL
  students were also given the opportunity to attend the various social
  events held during OSCON. The Lab hosted a lunch at Rock Bottom
  Brewery on Wednesday, with industry partners, alumni and hosted FOSS
  projects attending. The OSL and its guests shared good conversation
  over a delicious meal.Wyman states, “The parties were really awesome,
  not because of the party aspect, but because that’s really what it’s
  like to be in the tech industry. It was nice to meet professionals and
  talk to people who were as interested in computers as I am.”Whether it
  was gathering information at the booths, attending an informational
  session or simply networking with open source professionals, OSCON
  proved to be a valuable educational experience for the Open Source
  Lab. We look forward to next year! Category: `OSCON`_

`Google Migration Post-mortem`_
-------------------------------
  Submitted by Justin Dugger on July 3, 2014 ` `_ OSU administration
  recently approached the OSL asking us to help migrate their email
  archives to Google. Through contacts with other local universities
  that had made the switch recently, we discovered that Portland State
  University had written and `published`_ an open source Python app to
  manage the process. In the name of expedience, we decided to fork that
  project and use that as our base from which to `extend`_.Having had
  time to reflect, I’d like to share a few lessons from the
  experience:1. Enterprise means customized. All software comes bundled
  with biases and assumptions; small teams may be better off adapting
  their organization to fit those assumptions, but there exists a
  threshold beyond which it is easier to adjust software to fit the
  organization's assumptions instead. Despite forking a completed
  application, we found ourselves making several customizations and
  undoing several assumptions made by upstream developers.It was
  constantly tempting to rewrite and generalize the software, but data
  migration in particular is usually only done once, so any benefits
  from investments made into code quality will mainly accrue to those
  that come after us. Instead of aiming for perfection, we settled on
  good enough to meet the client's needs, while leaving the app better
  off than we found it. We formalized Python library dependencies using
  pip, ported the application to the latest Django version, and adopted
  some Django app organizational practices `from Mozilla`_.2. Pace your
  app. 3rd party APIs, including ` Google`_, rate limit requests to
  prevent people like us from accidentally DDoSing their systems... kind
  of. The main limit is one mail per second per inbox. The clever
  engineer will recognize that with tens of thousands of inboxes, we can
  still push several thousand emails to Google per second, so long as
  the app is parallelized wisely.The app we selected used a task queue
  with worker nodes pulling from it. Syncing one inbox is a task, so we
  have * n* concurrent inbox sync tasks running in parallel. This design
  is simple to scale up/down, and properly divides up the work with the
  API's rate limit in mind. Task queues are a good model, and one I've
  used before for this sort of task, so we left the architecture
  alone.It was a good chance to learn about RabbitMQ deployment
  specifics and monitoring tools; unfortunately what I discovered was
  that most tools are instrumented for tasks per second while our
  application was best measured in tasks per hour. This wasn't a huge
  problem, but it meant that I had to write my own instrumentation to
  estimate how long syncing all users might take, or how many extra
  worker nodes to spin up to meet any given deadline.3. Config
  management FTW. Especially for one-off apps that you don't expect to
  live long, it can be tempting to set up a VM and get it working, then
  just clone it into production a couple of times. It certainly makes
  the initial deploy simple, but making changes becomes difficult once
  you discover you need to scale up to several dozen worker VMs.I think
  most sysadmins understand that config management works well for high
  scale web environments at Google, Facebook or Amazon. What is lost on
  many sysadmins is how configuration management tools are also useful
  for collaboration. By using configuration management tools that treat
  the infrastructure like code, a new strategy emerges: manage ops like
  one manages devs. You provide them with a number of tools: revision
  control, production/development branches, peer review, etc. From this
  perspective, Chef and Puppet make all kinds of sense. It’s also great
  at documenting how your infrastructure is set up for coworkers. Or
  yourself, six months later: “Any software project is a collaborative
  project. It has at least two developers, the original developer and
  the original developer a few weeks or months later when the train of
  thought has long left the station.” --`Peter Hutterer`_ Until you've
  tried it, you have no idea how useful it is to be able to run git grep
  on your infrastructure. It’s quite useful to know all the places that
  your infrastructure references a specific server you need to take
  offline, or what the Apache configuration looked like back before you
  tried to integrate LDAP authentication with the SVN repo.So having
  learned and applied these lessons, what did we accomplish? By mid
  December, roughly half of the student population had opted into the
  Google apps domain. This greatly reduced the time spent during the
  last weekend of December for the final sync of approximately 24k
  remaining inboxes. OSU Helpdesk was also happy with the gradual
  migration; infrastructure changes implemented all at once lead to
  large temporary increases in calls, and makes staffing and scheduling
  much harder. Category: `Tech Blog`_

`Vim Trick FTW!`_
-----------------
  Submitted by Josh Gilardi on June 11, 2014 ` `_ Recently, I learned a
  useful Vim trick. One of our hosted clients has a Dokuwiki instance
  that we help manage, and they were having problems with a lot of spam
  user accounts being created. We added a CAPCHA to the wiki to make it
  less convenient for new spammers to join, but there were a lot of bad
  accounts already existing. By "a lot," I mean there were 112,808
  accounts listed in `users.auth.php`, and only about a dozen real
  project personnel using the wiki on a regular basis.To clean it out,
  we decided the best course of action would be deleting every account
  except those with admin privileges, because most of the real humans
  were in the admin group and those who weren't could get the project
  leader to re-add their accounts. The benefit of clearing out a hundred
  thousand spammers would, in this case, outweigh the inconvenience of
  manually recreating a couple of real accounts.It turns out that
  DokuWiki's interface isn't set up to bulk delete users based on group
  membership -- one really shouldn't get that many spammers in to begin
  with, so this is an unusual case. However, I'm not forced to use only
  the graphical interface. DokuWiki's configurations are stored in .php
  files in `/var/www/wikiname/conf`. Each line in `users.auth.php`
  represents one user account, and is of the form `user:MD5password:Real
  Name:email:groups,comma,separated`.I was familiar with the Vim command
  `:d/pattern/g` to delete all lines containing a pattern, but this time
  I needed to delete all lines that didn't have 'admin' in them. A
  little research revealed the command `:v/pattern/d`, which deletes all
  lines except those which match the pattern. Since many of the spammers
  (73 out of our 112,808, but still too many to hand-delete each) were
  using `admin@` email addresses, simply deleting all the lines without
  'admin' in them wasn't good enough. Instead, since I know all the
  users in the admin group have their group permissions in the form
  "admin,user," the command that removed everyone except the admin users
  was ``:v/admin,user/d``.If you're newer to the Bash shell, you may be
  wondering how I got the specific numbers of spammers. I made a backup
  of the users.auth.php file before deleting users, just in case the
  client changed their mind. Since DokuWiki had automatically created a
  `users.auth.php.bak`, I created my own backup of the users.auth with
  ``cp users.auth.php users.auth.php.bak2``. Now I can look back at the
  user list full of spammers and say ``wc -l users.auth.php.bak2`` to
  count the lines in it (since there's one account per line) and ``grep
  admin@ users.auth.php.bak2 | wc -l`` to count how many of the former
  users had `admin@` email addresses. Category: `Tech Blog`_

`Protein Geometry - What the Heck is That?`_
--------------------------------------------
  Submitted by Josh Gilardi on May 29, 2014 ` `_ When I bumped into my
  biochemistry professor, Dr. Kevin Ahern, on campus a few months ago, I
  had the pleasure of explaining how I actually get to use what I
  learned in his class. And at the Open Source Lab of all places. At the
  lab, I’ve had the opportunity to work on an open source project called
  the Protein Geometry Database (PGD), and my coursework as a food
  science major with fermentation science option -- specifically, that
  course in biochemistry -- has proven unexpectedly helpful when working
  on the PGD. The Protein Geometry Database was originally created in
  2008 by Dr. Donald Berkholz and Dr. P. Andrew Karplus, in conjunction
  with Peter Krenesky and John Davidson at the Open Source Lab. An
  extremely brief summary of the database: proteins consist of
  polypeptide chains, which themselves consist of amino acid residues.
  The dihedral angles between the residues and other characteristics of
  the bonds found within are influenced by the side chains of those
  residues and of their neighbors near and far. These characteristics
  are among the many attributes that are of interest to researchers like
  Drs. Berkholz and Karplus, both of Oregon State University's
  Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics. Since that time, the PGD
  has evolved and matured to fit the needs of researchers both on- and
  off-campus, maintained primarily by student developers at the Open
  Source Lab. An example of this is the usage of PGD by cancer
  researchers at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia to improve
  their understanding of structural details at the 0.1 angstrom level,
  which may assist them in identifying compounds of interest for cancer-
  fighting drugs.All software development projects require two sets of
  skills: those pertaining to the various technologies (languages,
  frameworks and the like), and having a basic understanding of the
  concepts being modeled. The PGD is written in Python, and currently
  uses the Django framework to provide a web interface to a database
  containing protein sequences. Having experience with Django and Python
  is necessary, but not sufficient, because familiarity with protein
  structures is required to truly grok the PGD codebase. One example
  from the PGD is Ramachandran plots. These plots help researchers
  identify secondary structures in proteins. Two of these structures --
  alpha helices and beta strands -- were discovered by Linus Pauling OSU
  ‘22. Having covered these plots and their purpose in biochemistry
  class gave me a leg up on understanding the software used to generate
  the plots in the PGD. *Hold on tight, we're about to get seriously
  technical.*The sequence of amino acid residues in polypeptide chains
  is the primary structure, while the interactions between nearby
  residues generates the secondary structure. Amino acids are the
  building blocks of proteins. They are composed of three groups
  surrounding a central carbon atom: an amine (-NH2) group, a carboxylic
  acid (-COOH) group, and a side chain. A peptide bond is formed between
  two amino acids when the amine group from one amino acid loses a
  hydrogen atom while the carboxylic group from another amino acid loses
  a hydroxide ion. The amino acid residues remain bonded while the
  hydrogen atom and hydroxide ion form a water molecule and are lost.
  The backbone of the polypeptide chain therefore consists of three
  atoms per residue: the nitrogen atom from the amine group, the central
  carbon atom, and the carbon atom from the carboxylic acid group. Bonds
  between these atoms have three dihedral angles associated with them:
  phi, psi, and omega. Phi and psi are heavily influenced by the side
  chains of the residues while omega is primarily influenced by the
  planarity of the peptide bond. For more information on the topic,
  download "Biochemistry Free & Easy" by Dr. Kevin Ahern and Dr. Indira
  Rajagopal at `http://biochem.science.oregonstate.edu/biochemistry-
  free-and-easy`_. This was the textbook for my biochemistry class and
  is chock-full of Dr. Ahern's poetry and songs as well as the sort of
  information one has come to expect from high-quality college

`OpenStack on OpenPOWER`_
-------------------------
  Submitted by Lance Albertson on April 23, 2014 ` `_ `Openstack`_ has
  been growing in popularity over the past few years and recently we’ve
  started to look into it further here at the OSL. We plan to continue
  to use `Ganeti`_ for our high-available IaaS needs, however we’re
  researching ways to integrate Openstack at the lab as well. While
  Ganeti provides a solid, stable and simple platform for general IaaS
  needs, Openstack provides better support for elastic and dynamic
  needs. We feel that using both platforms gives the best of both
  worlds, because they each fill a specific niche in a cloud
  environment.Earlier this year we teamed up with `IBM`_ to work on
  deploying Openstack on the `OpenPOWER architecture`_ with the goal of
  expanding our `Supercell infrastructure`_ beyond the x86 architecture.
  Thanks to the hard work by both the IBM and OSUOSL team, we’ve been
  able to deploy Openstack on four IBM OpenPOWER machines which support
  KVM and little endian. OpenStack on OpenPOWER screenshot running a
  Fedora Guest.Currently we have the nodes deployed on Fedora 20 with
  Fedora 20 guests working properly. We’re also working on getting
  Debian and Ubuntu guests to work properly. Our goal is to provide
  ppc64 guest images for the Openstack Community on OpenPOWER in
  addition to providing `OpenPOWER Openstack and KVM specific deployment
  documentation`_. We are planning to provide this platform to the
  general FOSS communities by early June 2014. To keep up to date on the
  status of the cluster, please feel free to subscribe to the `OSUOSL
  OpenPOWER announcement mailing list`_. Category: `Tech Blog`_

`Openstack's Horizon`_
----------------------
  Submitted by Melissa Morse on February 20, 2014 ` `_ *The first tech
  post is by Chance Zibolski, a community system administrator and
  project lead of Ganeti Web Manager, a Web administration panel that
  allows administrators and clients access to administer and use
  Google’s open source cloud infrastructure.*Recently the OSU Open
  Source Lab has been experimenting with different technologies, in
  particular Openstack. We already use Ganeti as our production virtual
  machine and cluster management system and have written a web front end
  called Ganeti Web Manager. The whole purpose of the web manager is to
  allow us to easily create new virtual machines for internal purposes
  and to provide our customers with cheap, redundant VMs. Recently, the
  OSL released `Ganeti Web Manager 0.10.2`_ and we’re getting close to
  finishing version 0.11. With this release, we’ve begun to discuss the
  future of Ganeti Web Manager and where we should be taking it. We’ve
  decided to eventually rewrite it. As the project lead of Ganeti Web
  Manager, it’s been my job to explore what tools and libraries we may
  want to use for new versions of the project.This is what led me to
  Openstack. Recently, we deployed an Openstack test cluster in our
  infrastructure, and I found that its web UI (known as Horizon)
  provides a lot of awesome functionality to Openstack users. The
  dashboard provides a full interface to the existing Openstack CLI
  tools, and lets users create new VMs with a few clicks of a button,
  all using a web interface. I began to explore how we might be able to
  use Horizon in order to accomplish our rewrite. As I discovered on the
  `Horizon Github`_ page the project has already been mostly separated
  out from the Openstack dashboard and can be used as a general purpose
  dashboard library for Django. Horizon provides utilities from mapping
  Django models to interactive/editable tables to creating tabbed page
  layouts and multiple step modal windows for performing actions.
  Openstack Horizon screenshot.Utilizing the basic layout the pre-
  existing Openstack dashboard uses, I was able to create a working
  prototype of a Horizon dashboard that interfaces with a Ganeti
  cluster. (See the code here:
  `https://github.com/osuosl/ganeti_horizon`_.) It doesn’t do much—other
  than read cluster data and display it—and so far it only has about
  three or four different pages created. Based on my testing, I think
  Horizon is an excellent way to begin with a Django-based dashboard,
  and we will likely use it in our rewrite.If you will be writing a
  dashboard, I recommend taking a look at Horizon and seeing if it might
  fit your needs. At first it may seem like it’s built for a very
  specific use case, but you might be able to use it in your next
  dashboard project. Category: `Tech Blog`_

`DevOps Bootcamp extends OSL reach`_
------------------------------------
  Submitted by Melissa Morse on December 16, 2013 ` `_ Sometimes, it’s
  hard to be popular. The increasing popularity of open source means
  that there are always more students interested in the Open Source Lab
  than we have the ability to hire and mentor. In order to increase the
  lab’s reach and educate more people about FOSS, the lab created a new
  program, DevOps Bootcamp. Spearheaded by Emily Dunham, a student
  system administrator, and modeled after Portland State University’s
  `Braindump`_, this program will allow more people from outside of the
  OSL to learn valuable FOSS skills. The unique DevOps Bootcamp
  curriculum focuses on both software development and systems
  administration. Designed to be accessible to complete beginners, the
  course aims to take potential open source contributors from no
  knowledge to a solid grasp of the basics in a year. The informal class
  covers the following key areas: linux basics, basic system
  administration, basic FOSS development methodologies, base
  infrastructure services for any organization (DNS, Email, etc), and
  building a simulated infrastructure for a company from top to bottom.
  Dunham, who also worked as a teaching assistant, feels she is gaining
  valuable experience sharing her expertise with new people.“Because
  it’s the first time we’re offering this class, it’s a learning
  experience for everyone,” says Dunham. “I’m learning as much about how
  to teach as they are learning about devops.”DevOps Bootcamp is held on
  Thursdays from 6-8 pm and is open to anyone in the community. Not only
  is the course about open source, the course itself is open source. The
  curriculum, based on the `Computer Science 312`_ course the lab taught
  in 2009, is available on the DevOps Bootcamp website. In addition,
  `Youtube videos`_ of the classes are posted online and students can
  ask questions on IRC (#devopsbootcamp on freenode). The first meeting
  was successful, with 34 people in attendance.“I’m really happy with
  the number of people that weren’t just sitting there,” says Dunham.
  “They asked questions and demonstrated that they were engaged and
  participating.”For more information, please visit

`Connecting at Beaver BarCamp 12 `_
-----------------------------------
  Submitted by Melissa Morse on October 17, 2013 ` `_ More than 160
  students, community members and educators gathered in the Kelley
  Engineering Center at Oregon State to share ideas, make connections
  and learn together at the Open Source Lab’s Beaver BarCamp 12 on
  Saturday, October 12. An informal conference hosted twice each year by
  the Open Source Lab, Beaver BarCamp encourages attendees to
  participate by both presenting sessions and participating in
  discussions. Throughout the day, 50 sessions were presented, with
  topics ranging from Python programming to starting a business to
  creating a universe.At Beaver BarCamp, sessions are scheduled the
  morning of the event: everyone writes the session they are interested
  in presenting on a Post-It note. Interest in sessions is gauged by
  having participants place dot stickers on their favorite sessions.
  Next, OSL staff arrange the schedule according to the needs of the
  presenters and popularity of sessions. Wendy Kincade, a master’s
  student at the University of Oregon, has attended Beaver BarCamp since
  it began in 2008 and enjoys the freedom this aspect of BarCamp
  provides.“I love the idea of showing up and talking to people about
  stuff that I don’t know we’re going to talk about,” says Kincade. “The
  spontaneity of it is appealing to me.”In this way, Beaver BarCamp
  creates a unique setting for students and community members to meet
  new people and share their interests, hobbies and research. Ken Olsen,
  a software technician at Hewlett-Packard, enjoys coming to Beaver
  BarCamp for that reason. “If I had to explain BarCamp to someone who
  hasn't been, I would say it is a unique opportunity to share
  information and skills, and make connections with others who have
  similar interests,” Olsen says.Olsen was able to make long-lasting
  connections during the Beaver BarCamp, because the cooperative
  atmosphere allowed attendees to participate in the instruction. Olsen
  presented a session about microcomputers, such as Raspberry Pi and
  Arduino. When a participant needed help while Olsen was busy, someone
  with programming experience stepped in. “I found not only a great
  student, but also a great mentor who I invited to come assist me (at
  future workshops) as well,” says Olsen.Students from five different
  Oregon campuses attended Beaver BarCamp on Saturday, enabling more
  collaboration and networking between Oregon universities. Students and
  educators from across Oregon’s university system welcomed the
  opportunity to socialize and learn with each other.“This is the second
  time I’ve come,” says Donovan Finch, a Portland State University
  student majoring in computer science. “It’s a great chance to meet
  people from the tech community, especially from other
  universities.”Students can also benefit from Beaver BarCamp by taking
  advantage of the opportunity to practice their speaking skills in a
  more relaxed atmosphere. PowerPoint karaoke, a popular session held at
  the end of the day, is a game where random PowerPoint slides are taken
  from the internet and a volunteer gives the presentation — without
  knowing what they will present. The volunteer has to make it up as
  they go along, allowing students and professionals to practice
  impromptu speaking. Russ Earl, a software engineer with Intel,
  attended Beaver BarCamp for the first time and participated in
  PowerPoint karaoke. “I'd heard about PowerPoint karaoke but didn't
  quite know what to expect,” says Earl. “It was a fun time and a good
  chance to practice speaking skills.”Sponsors `Mozilla`_, `Tag1
  Consulting`_, `Github`_ and `Silicon Mechanics`_ funded the conference
  and made it possible for everyone to enjoy a full schedule of
  sessions, as well as food, refreshments and T-shirts.The next Beaver
  BarCamp is scheduled for April 12, 2014. Category: `Beaver Barcamp`_

`A look back at Beaver BarCamp 1`_
----------------------------------
  Submitted by Melissa Morse on August 19, 2013 ` `_ A session during
  the first Beaver BarCamp (Photo by Timothy Budd)After attending
  `BarCamp Portland`_, Alex Polvi was inspired to create a similar
  opportunity for Corvallis. At the time, Polvi was a computer science
  student at Oregon State University, and he approached Associate
  Professor Timothy Budd about creating a BarCamp on campus. After
  driving up to Portland with some students in order to see a how a
  BarCamp is organized, Budd began creating the first Beaver BarCamp,
  with the help of his students and Corvallis community members from the
  Software Association of Oregon. The first Beaver BarCamp was held on
  March 1, 2008.Timing is everything, and it just so happened that Budd
  had recently received a grant from IBM to promote open source
  technology. With those funds, the group was able to pay for food,
  t-shirts, and the rental fee for the Kelley Engineering Center, all
  essential elements of holding a BarCamp.“It was nice to not have to
  worry about fundraising as we were figuring everything else out,” Budd
  says.Budd viewed the BarCamp “unconference” format as a unique way to
  forge ties with the local open source community. Although one of
  Budd’s challenges was doing publicity on a small budget, the first
  Beaver BarCamp attracted over 100 participants, including a mix of
  students and local technical community members. “I was surprised at
  the first camp that we actually had more nonstudents than students,”
  Budd says. “Although, a lot of students tended to show up once the
  free food was placed out.”At this first event, session topics focused
  on the technical: Intro to Linq and Mud Hut Programming, for example.
  In the evening, the format shifted from hour-long discussions to an
  “Ignite” format, where each presenter is allowed 15 slides with 15
  seconds per slide for each presenter.The success of Beaver BarCamp led
  OSL Director Lance Albertson to step into the role of organizer when
  the program needed new leadership, bringing Beaver BarCamp under the
  OSL’s umbrella. A part of the OSL’s outreach efforts, Beaver BarCamp
  provides a way for the University and the local technology community
  to collaborate and share ideas.“The students really enjoy it, it’s a
  great way to recruit new students (to the OSL) and to show the
  community what we’re doing,” Albertson says. Although Polvi and Budd
  are long gone from Oregon State’s campus, Beaver BarCamp continues to
  thrive as a part of their legacy. The program has expanded to include
  non-technical session topics and continues to draw members of the
  local community to campus.“It gives the opportunity for anyone to get
  public speaking skills and gives us a platform to share what we do,”
  Albertson says. “It’s an open house of sorts.” `Beaver BarCamp 12`_ is
  scheduled for October 12, 2013. Follow us `@beaverbarcamp`_ to stay

`OSL Announces 10 year Celebration; Attends OSCON`_
---------------------------------------------------
  Submitted by Melissa Morse on July 30, 2013 ` `_ The Open Source Lab
  (OSL) recently kicked off its 10 year celebration at the O’Reilly Open
  Source Conference in Portland July 23 - 26. Over the last decade, the
  OSL has contributed much to the recent growth of the open source
  community and is using this milestone to reflect on its past
  accomplishments and to create goals for the future. By focusing to
  ‘Build The Future’ in three key areas: education, outreach, and
  research and infrastructure, the lab will strengthen its position as
  an open source leader.“It’s an important milestone," says OSL Director
  Lance Albertson. "We’re not just a small group of people anymore but a
  maturing organization with a smart staff of both students and non-
  students."` `_ Icons used to represent the three key areas of the
  `Build The Future`_ initiative: education, outreach and research &
  infrastructure.Further enabling the lab to expand its emphasis on
  education and fulfill its mission to promote open source technology
  globally, the OSL recently joined Oregon State’s School of Electrical
  Engineering and Computer Science (EECS). This joint effort will help
  the OSL and the EECS to expand open source curriculum, mentor an
  increasing number of students and promote open source technologies in
  the public sector.“It's exciting to see everybody having positive
  feedback for us moving into EECS," Albertson says. "Becoming part of
  the EECS department will enable us to reach out to more students
  interested in FOSS (free open source software) or the OSL than we
  normally do. Sky’s the limit on what we are capable of doing with this
  migration.”One of the many ways the OSL promotes open source education
  is by attending conferences, and as one of the largest open source
  conferences, OSCON provides many avenues to do so with over 3,900
  attendees and 100-plus company booths. At the conference, the OSL
  hosted a booth in the nonprofit pavillion, and students and staff
  enjoyed interacting with members of the open source community. “OSCON
  was awesome," OSL Student Developer Geoff Corey says. "It was fun
  working the booth and telling people from different backgrounds what
  exactly we do at the OSL”. "Hosted by the OSL" signs for the OSL's
  hosted communities.The OSL handed out placards to the many open source
  projects hosted by the lab that also had booths in the OSCON expo
  hall, visually demonstrating the impact the lab has on the open source
  community. In addition, several community members stopped by to meet
  the students and staff that support their projects, facilitate their
  downloads, or provide technical help.Corey thought “it was pretty cool
  how many big companies knew about us and our many services we provide
  to people showed how big our impact really is in the open source
  community”.On Tuesday night of the conference, the lab hosted an
  alumni party in appreciation of the students and staff that have
  contributed to the lab’s success with 50 guests showing up.
  Celebrating the OSL’s 10 year celebration, the OSL provided food along
  with a slideshow displaying the history of the lab and Squishymedia
  generously donated the use of their office space in downtown Portland
  to help in the party efforts. The atmosphere felt like a family
  reunion, as old friends reconnected and new employees were welcomed.
  OSL Director, Lance Albertson, and past OSL Project Manager, Greg
  Lund-Chaix, speak about the history of the OSL at the alumni party
  hosted at `Squishymedia`_.“Once you are a part of the OSL, you are
  always a part of it,” says Greg Lund-Chaix, Squishymedia tech lead and
  former OSL project manager. “I still use ‘we’ when I refer to the
  lab.”According to Albertson, the slideshow made him think about what
  it took to create the OSL."The OSL became what it is because we had
  the right connections, opportunities, people, and sponsors at the
  right time," Albertson says. Category: `OSCON`_

`Open Source Bridge Promotes Community`_
----------------------------------------
  Submitted by Melissa Morse on June 24, 2013 Attendees at Open Source
  Bridge 2013 preparing for the conference.With the open source
  conference season well underway, OSL students and staff were excited
  to attend `Open Source Bridge`_ at the Eliot Center in downtown
  Portland from June 18-21. Now in its fifth year, the conference
  provided a unique opportunity for the open source community to connect
  and share with each other.Besides great vegetarian food, one of the
  ways conference organizers promoted a feeling of community was with
  the hacker lounge, sponsored by Intel. Comfortable seating, plenty of
  power strips and wifi, a 3-D printer and a Lego table added to the
  atmosphere of creativity. For OSL Director Lance Albertson, the hacker
  lounge was the most important part of Open Source Bridge.“It provides
  a place to start a conversation, work together and find out other cool
  projects people are doing,” Albertson says.Another unique aspect of
  Open Source Bridge is that it’s completely run by volunteers. This
  prompted Jenn Garcia, OSL student outreach manager, to volunteer this
  year; she worked as a session chair and assistant volunteer
  coordinator. Garcia was impressed with how friendly the open source
  community was.“My favorite thing about volunteering was the people I
  got to meet,” Garcia says.In addition to promoting community, Open
  Source Bridge offers valuable content during sessions. Conference
  organizers created `five tracks`_ for presentations: Culture,
  Business, Hacks, Cooking, and Chemistry. Albertson was impressed with
  the variety of content offered this year. Session topics he attended
  ranged from `Leveling up in DevOps: the Art of Bad Shell Scripts`_ to
  `Hacking the Academic Experience`_.“I really enjoyed the diversity of
  not only the people attending but also the session topics,” Albertson
  says. “I noticed a wider variety of topics this year than in the past
  --from advanced technical to sociological topics.” Lance Albertson
  giving a presentation on how the OSU Open Source Lab mentors
  "rockstar" students.In the culture track, the OSL presented `How We
  Mentor “Rock Star” Students`_, in conjunction with `Portland State
  University’s CAT`_ presentation Zero to Root in 12 Months. Albertson
  and Senior Software Engineer Ken Lett emphasized that mentoring
  college students involves much more than teaching code.“We teach
  students to collaborate with each other and with the open source
  community,” Albertson says. “All of our developers are on IRC, and our
  students answer user questions.”Lett explained that experienced
  students are encouraged to take leadership roles on projects at the
  OSL. Student-to-student mentoring fosters relationships at the OSL and
  helps students learn.“Students really blossom when they get to teach
  others about cool new things,” Lett says.Teaching others is an
  integral part of Open Source Bridge, and this year’s conference was no
  exception. The OSL staff is looking forward to implementing what we’ve
  learned--and to attending again next year.“OS Bridge continues to be
  the best diverse, community-driven conference in the world,” Albertson
  says.Conference organizers have already started planning the next
  conference, which will be held June 24-27, 2014. (Early bird
  registration is available). Category: `Conferences`_

`OSL to Mentor Four in Google Summer of Code`_
----------------------------------------------
  Submitted by Kayla Harr on June 5, 2013 Students from India, Poland
  and the United Kingdom will work on projects for the OSL this summer.
  The Oregon State University Open Source Lab has accepted four college
  students from around the world as `Google Summer of Code 2013`_
  participants. The four students will work on projects for the OSL over
  the summer with Google’s sponsorship and OSL staff members’ mentoring
  and supervision.The OSL has not had four GSOC students since 2010. OSL
  Director Lance Albertson attributes this year’s increased number of
  students, compared to only one in 2012, to a greater variety of
  available projects.“We had more projects that people were interested
  in this year,” Albertson says. “I think this year’s group of students
  is going to be pretty good; each of them have been proactive about
  contacting us and excited about working on their projects.” Polish
  automation control and robotics student Piotr Banaszkiewicz will be
  working with the lab through Google summer programs for the third
  consecutive year, and his project will focus on improving the
  modularity, packaging and installation of the OSL’s `Ganeti Web
  Manager`_. Two students from India will also work on GWM-related
  projects; Ahmed Shabib Bolwar, a computer science engineering student,
  will add a GWM provider to `Vagrant`_, while Pranjal Mittal, who is
  studying electronics engineering, will add visualization to clusters,
  nodes and virtual machines in GWM. A fourth student, Mark Antony
  Holland, who is from the United Kingdom and currently studying
  computer science in Spain, will work on incorporating functionality
  and user-interface improvements to the OSL-developed `Android
  OpenConferenceWare app`_.The students will be mentored by OSL full-
  time developer Ken Lett, student developer Justin Noah and Albertson.
  Aside from having an array of time zones to accommodate this year,
  Albertson says working with GSOC students abroad is similar to
  collaborating with student employees in the lab.“It’s kind of like
  what we do with students here but compressed,” he says. “We’re
  interacting with students from all over the world, and understanding
  their cultural differences too.”Albertson hopes working with
  professionals through the Open Source Lab will help the students learn
  communication and teamwork skills, as well as offer them the
  experience of following a project through from draft to completion.
  And while they’re gaining valuable real-world experience, he says, the
  students will also be helping to advance development projects at the
  OSL.“Everything they do is going to be beneficial to the lab long-
  term,” Albertson says. “And I hope in their careers being able to say
  they had that experience will help them.” Category: `Google Summer of

`OSL Staff Participate at DrupalCon 2013`_
------------------------------------------
  Submitted by Melissa Morse on June 4, 2013 ` `_ Open Source Lab staff
  members attended `DrupalCon`_ May 20-24 at the Oregon Convention
  Center in Portland. OSL attendees welcomed the opportunity to
  contribute and learn during the many sessions and social events.“It
  was so good to see everyone in the open source community, meet new
  people and reconnect with people I only see once a year,” says Rudy
  Grigar, senior systems architect.The OSL presented `Put the Ops in
  Dev: What Developers Need to Know about Devops`_, a session to teach
  developers what they need to know about operations to improve the
  maintainability of their code in production. Grigar said that the
  session was fun to present, because they had good participation.“We
  had lots of good questions at the end of the session from the Drupal
  community,” Grigar says.Another session presented by the OSL was
  `Empowering K-12 Schools through Drupal and other FOSS Tools`_. Greg
  Lund-Chaix, a former OSL developer who was instrumental in the
  creation of the `Oregon Virtual School District`_, discussed how ORVSD
  benefits Oregon teachers and school districts. Lund-Chaix explained
  that ORVSD is a resource teachers can use to supplement their in-class
  instruction but is not designed to replace classroom teachers or
  provide high school credit.“This is a tool to do better, not a tool to
  do more,” Lund-Chaix says.In addition, OSL Senior Software Engineer
  Ken Lett discussed the ways ORVSD is currently being utilized by
  school districts and fielded audience questions.In the expo hall, OSL
  Director Lance Albertson was pleased to see the wide variety of
  technology companies using Drupal, which has been hosted at the OSL
  since 2005.“I thought it was amazing to see the different designs,
  deployments and unique ways Drupal is being used,” Albertson says.For
  example, `Videx`_, an access control and data collection company
  located in Corvallis, uses Drupal as the basis for their electronic
  lock systems. The diversity of companies using Drupal demonstrates the
  popularity of the content management system and its continued
  growth.The OSL would like to thank the many Drupalcon event sponsors.

Letter from the Director
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*Dear Friends,* After working for nearly six years as the Oregon State
University Open Source Lab’s lead systems engineer and the associate
director, I became the lab’s new director in January. My involvement
in the open source community began in 2003 with the `Gentoo Linux
distribution`_, and I am excited for the opportunity I will have to
continue promoting and supporting FOSS in my new role. The OSL is
unique for its heavy reliance on a student workforce to power the lab,
and I plan to find new ways to further develop and expand our
students’ abilities.This year marks the 10th anniversary of the OSL
and we're proud to see what we've accomplished over the past decade. I
want to extend my thanks to everyone who has helped and contributed to
the lab during those 10 years. It’s amazing to think how much the lab
has impacted the open source ecosystem during that time. We can only
imagine what the next 10 years will be like, but I know that the lab
will continue to be a key player in the FOSS ecosystem.In other news,
the lab has been selected for a seventh straight year as a `Google
Summer of Code 2013 mentoring organization`_. I'm proud to see the lab
participating in this program again and look forward to interacting
with students from all over the world. In addition we had another
successful `Beaver BarCamp `_this past weekend with more than 150
people in attendance, including a regiment of at least 35 students
from Portland State University and several past OSL students and
staff. We look forward to having our next Beaver BarCamp October 12,
2013. In closing, I would like to thank all of the lab staff and
students who work hard on a daily basis to improve the FOSS ecosystem.
They do amazing work!Best wishes, *Lance Albertson*


New Projects at the OSL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*The list of projects and communities the OSL supports through hosting
and other services is always growing. Notable projects that have
recently found a home at the OSL include:*


Systers
```````
A thriving email community for women in computing, Systers has been
connecting and supporting women in computer science since 1987. The
project came to the OSL this year in need of a managed hosting
provider with experience hosting Mailman mailing lists. The lab is now
hosting two virtual machines for Systers, one for their production
mailman lists and a second one for open source development of patches
that will eventually become part of Mailman 3.0.


Python Software Foundation
``````````````````````````
As a large foundation, the Python Software Foundation has been
previously scattered about various data centers around the world. PSF
was looking for a more permanent home for many of its services and
chose the OSL. The lab has hosted a Ganeti private cloud for PSF since
spring 2012, and the project has continued moving various services to
the OSL-managed cloud.


Featured Student - Eric Zounes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  *Eric Zounes has been a student system administrator at the Open
  Source Lab since June 2012. He works primarily on the Oregon Virtual
  School District project testing site upgrades and providing general
  system administration. Here, Eric answers some questions about his
  work at the OSL and what he’s planning for the future following his
  graduation this spring.* What do you enjoy about contributing to
  ORVSD? The ORVSD project is a fun technical challenge since we are
  building our own platform as a service. I also enjoy providing service
  to the participating Oregon public schools. Facilitating the education
  system in any way is important to me. How has working at the OSL
  benefitted you? I've learned a tremendous amount in such a short
  period of time working at the OSL. Students are immersed in an
  environment where each of us are passionate about open source. Many of
  the problems we solve never come up in academia, so the amount of
  practical experience we get really complements the content we learn in
  classes. What are your plans for next year? I plan on working for
  Mozilla on their Web Operations team. I also plan on contributing to
  several open source projects and taking some time off to travel.

`Students & Community Members Learn Together at Beaver BarCamp 11`_
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Submitted by Melissa Morse on May 1, 2013 ` `_Students, community
members and professionals gather before the first session at Beaver
BarCamp 11. More than 150 Oregon State students, community members and
students from other Oregon universities gathered in the Kelley
Engineering building April 20 to attend the Open Source Lab’s Beaver
BarCamp 11. Attendees presented nearly 50 sessions on a wide range of
topics ranging from the technical to the recreational, including
successful system administration, mead brewing and how to turn a
T-shirt into a tie.The open, supportive atmosphere found at Beaver
BarCamp encourages students and community members to come together,
share what they know and learn from each other. After OSL Director
Lance Albertson’s welcome speech, Beaver BarCamp participants created
the schedule together, adding session titles to the board on large
Post-it notes.Sessions can be changed and added throughout the day, a
feature participants took full advantage of as sessions were juggled
to meet group interest in particular topics. When a session on
Raspberry Pi single-board computers presented by Ken Olsen, a software
technician at Hewlett-Packard, outgrew the room it was assigned to,
the group moved to a larger room and a second Raspberry Pi session was
added to the schedule.` `_Hewlett-Packard software technician Ken
Olsen discusses Raspberry Pi and Arduino. “I like the informal quality
of it because it’s open, it’s casual, it’s inviting,” says Nate
Robison, a senior studying computer science at Western Oregon
University. Several sessions at Beaver BarCamp 11 were designed for
beginners or to help experienced coders expand their skills. Oregon
State Ecampus student Bryon Burleigh drove to Beaver BarCamp 11 from
his home in Bend, Ore., hoping to improve his coding skills. Burleigh
is pursuing a post-baccalaureate degree in computer science and
appreciated the opportunity to learn about open source and connect
with fellow students. “I want to learn about version control in
person, and Beaver BarCamp gives me a way to do that,” Burleigh says.
Beaver BarCamp encourages attendees not only to learn, but also to
share their knowledge. Because the unconference is open to everyone
and doesn’t require registration, it’s a great way for everyone from
tech professionals to students to share their passion and
expertise.Contributors may bring slides or visuals to illustrate their
sessions, but a formal presentation is not necessary. Oregon State
senior David Fontenot, who is studying computer science, enjoyed this
aspect of Beaver BarCamp. During his presentation, Emacs for
Beginners, Fontenot spontaneously pulled up some of his homework
online in response to a question and showed attendees some step-by-
step techniques. “I like teaching,” Fontenot says. “I recently started
focusing on Emacs, and I felt like I had something to contribute.” `
`_The Beaver BarCamp 11 schedule displays the nearly 50 sessions held
throughout the day. Sponsors `Dice.com`_, `Jive`_, `Github`_ and
`Silicon Mechanics`_ funded the conference and made it possible for
everyone to enjoy a full schedule of sessions, as well as refreshments
and T-shirts. In addition, representatives from gold sponsor Dice.com
attended Beaver BarCamp 11, allowing attendees interested in pursuing
work as technology professionals to network with the premiere career
hub for jobs in the tech industry. “Our website is catered to IT
professionals in the workforce now and also future IT professionals
specifically,” says Vince Maccario, a brand ambassador representing
Dice. “We specifically want to support these students.” Looking for

`OSL to Participate in Google Summer of Code 2013`_
---------------------------------------------------
  Submitted by Kayla Harr on April 11, 2013 This year will be the lab's
  seventh straight as a GSOC mentor. Open Source Lab staff are excited
  to announce that the lab has been accepted as a Google Summer of Code
  mentoring organization for the seventh year running. GSoC is a
  valuable opportunity for collaboration between the lab and young
  programmers around the world. In the past, the lab has worked with
  students from China, Portugal, Venezuela and Poland, offering them
  mentorship and guidance as they complete tasks to advance projects at
  the OSL.This year, the lab has several development projects available
  for GSoC students to apply their skills to. As mentors, lab staff
  members strive to support student learning and offer an experience
  that will improve their future work in a number of contexts. “GSoC
  exposes young programmers to real-world development and introduces
  them into the open source community,” says Ken Lett, an OSL developer
  who mentored the lab’s 2012 GSoC student. “Being able to contribute
  real and useful code to real projects can be a very inspiring
  experience, and working on projects with professional standards and
  development processes will be useful for their own careers.” Students
  who are interested in working with the OSL in GSoC 2013 can learn more

`OSL Staff Mentors International Students Through Google Summer of
Code`_
------
  Submitted by Kayla Harr on February 11, 2013 ` `_ Real-world work
  experience is one of the most valuable things an employer can provide
  to students preparing to enter the job market. At the Oregon State
  University Open Source Lab, that experience is readily available to 19
  part-time student employees who balance their coursework at Oregon
  State with a job that offers them professional training. But the lab’s
  influence on ambitious students reaches beyond Oregon State, and even
  the United States, through Google’s Summer of Code program.The summer
  program connects students 18 years and older around the world with
  mentors in the open source field and sponsors their work for the
  summer. As a GSoC mentoring organization since 2006, the OSL has had
  students from countries around the world, including China, Portugal
  and Venezuela, contribute to in-house development projects. Last
  summer, 19-year-old Polish student Piotr Banaszkiewicz collaborated
  with developers and students at the lab to refine tools for Ganeti Web
  Manager, a virtual server management program developed at the OSL.
  “This is definitely the greatest and most valuable experience I could
  get,” he says. “Not everyone is fortunate enough to get it at this
  age.” Banaszkiewicz implemented a daemon to provide metrics in Ganeti
  that can be displayed as a graph of data about the virtual machines
  the program is running. According to OSL Senior Software Engineer Ken
  Lett, who supervised Banaszkiewicz’s work, this addition to Ganeti
  will contribute both to the software’s usability and to future
  development. “This allows system administrators to view the state and
  history of the machines in their cluster in a very visual and
  intuitive way,” Lett says. “His work also created an infrastructure on
  which further visualization and analysis tools can be built. Writing
  flexible, extensible and pluggable code not only makes our work easier
  in Ganeti Web Manager, but will hopefully inform and improve his
  future work in any type of programming.” Working with developers more
  than 5,500 miles away from his hometown near Cracow, Poland,
  Banaszkiewicz says, was only difficult because of the nine-hour time
  difference that meant staff members didn’t arrive for work at the OSL
  office until it was evening in Poland. But by connecting with OSL
  staff over Internet Relay Chat and sharing ideas through Google Docs,
  he says was able to learn from his mentors at the OSL and improve his
  knowledge about virtualization and working with Python and Vagrant. “I
  can see the OSL as a very pro-student organization, which I was
  delighted to work for,” he says. “There are some very passionate
  programmers, who actually were like teachers for me during GSoC.”
  Banaszkiewicz is unique among GSoC students the OSL has mentored in
  that he previously worked with the lab through Google Code-in, a
  program similar to GSoC but designed for high school students. He has
  been the only Google Code-in student to continue to be mentored by the
  OSL in GSoC. Performing tasks for the OSL as a high school student,
  Banaszkiewicz says, introduced him to the tools used in professional
  open source development. “I was a little younger and did not know many
  technologies used by the OSL team,” he says. “Now these technologies
  are obligatory in any project, and I'm very happy I could learn them
  so early.” Now, Banaszkiewicz is studying at the AGH University of
  Science in Cracow. He plans to apply to work as a GSoC student with
  the OSL again this summer and continue to expand his knowledge of open
  source development. The OSL’s continued participation in GSoC, Lett
  says, not only offers students a unique opportunity, but also presents
  a host of benefits both for the lab and the open source community.
  “Mentoring young open source developers bolsters the community we rely
  on, and helps make sure the new generation of open source developers
  comes in with real skill and knowledge,” Lett says. “It also creates
  connections that bring benefits back to us in the form of
  contributions to our projects, collaborations with other projects and
  relationships with developers around the world.” Media contact: Kayla

`Students, Community and Professionals Collaborate at Beaver BarCamp
10`_
----
  Submitted by Kayla Harr on November 3, 2012 ` `_ On Oct. 13, more than
  150 people gathered in Kelley Engineering Center to attend the Oregon
  State University Open Source Lab’s Beaver BarCamp 10. Beaver BarCamp
  is a semiannual unconference that brings together students as well as
  community members to discuss technology, recreation and ideas in an
  interactive setting.Beaver BarCamp 10 featured attendee-led sessions
  on a variety of topics and was sponsored by Mozilla, RackSpace and the
  Oregon State University School of Electrical Engineering and Computer
  Science. In addition to sessions held by students on topics ranging
  from whistling to virtualization to playing poker, Mozilla employees
  presented three sponsored sessions on Web security, writing for the
  Web and building open Web apps.“All of the talks by Mozilla were
  really cool,” says Chance Zibolski, an Oregon State computer science
  student. “I really enjoyed getting to learn a lot just by seeing what
  other people are working on.”Beaver BarCamp 10 attendees share lunch
  and conversation in the KEC. Photo courtesy of Mike Morgan.The OSL’s
  efforts to further the collaborative nature of Beaver BarCamp was
  evident with the variety of students present, who came not only from
  Oregon State but also from Portland State University and the
  University of Oregon.“I was so happy to see folks from the community,
  PSU, UO and OSU come together in the spirit of learning and open
  source,” says Mozilla employee Mike Morgan. “Sharing and collaborating
  should expand beyond university walls, and this was a good example of
  how to make it happen. It made me feel a sense of community and
  goodwill.”While students enjoyed the opportunity to learn from
  professionals, presenters from Mozilla said they valued the experience
  of interacting with students at Beaver BarCamp 10.“Beaver BarCamp is a
  great way to engage directly with students on a variety of interesting
  topics,” says Mozilla’s Director of Security Assurance Michael Coates.
  “Over the past two BarCamps, I've been able to host a Web application
  security hacking lab. I've been impressed by the interest level and
  enthusiasm from attendees and am looking forward to future
  events.”Morgan says that the caliber of student participation in the
  sessions he presented on writing for the Web and building open Web
  apps confirmed for him that Oregon State students, both inside and
  outside the OSL, are highly skilled.“Oregon State Students are
  amazing,” Morgan says. “Our Mozilla interns and full-time hires from
  Oregon State who worked at the OSL work shoulder-to-shoulder with
  other engineers from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Carnegie
  Mellon University and Stanford. Their work at Oregon State has
  prepared them for the real-world problem solving that Mozilla and
  other companies need from them. Coming to Beaver BarCamp showed me
  there are many more excellent engineers at Oregon State — they had
  great questions, understood the technology and are already well ahead
  of the curve.”Along with its characteristic variety of sessions —
  brewing beer, 3D printing and synthesizing sounds were just a few of
  the unique topics on the schedule — Beaver BarCamp 10 offered hands-on
  learning opportunities. While OSL Student Developer Corbin Simpson
  taught attendees to whistle with a little practice, workshops on
  virtualization and building applications encouraged those in
  attendance to break out their laptops and learn by doing.“I learned a
  lot about virtualization and I like that I can actually play with it,”
  says Brenn Kucey, a senior studying electrical engineering and
  computer science at Oregon State. “That’s what I like the most about
  it, that I was able to come in and see new areas that I can
  explore.”More interactive sessions, technical lessons and innovative
  ideas will come to Oregon State when Beaver BarCamp returns in the
  spring. Students and community members are welcome to share their own
  knowledge and learn from others this April at Beaver BarCamp 11.Media

`From Support to Success`_
--------------------------
  Submitted by Kayla Harr on August 18, 2012 When staff members at the
  Oregon State University Open Source Lab were working with creators of
  the Drupal content management system to provide free hosting services
  to the overloaded project in 2005, crisis hit. A server meltdown left
  all Drupal websites down for two days, emphasizing the project’s need
  for further support and motivating the community behind the open
  source project to donate double the amount needed to purchase a new
  server to be hosted at the OSL.As soon as the lab began hosting
  Drupal, two student system administrators, Narayan Newton and Eric
  Searcy, attacked the task of expanding the project’s overloaded
  infrastructure, building a cluster for Drupal’s websites that could be
  scaled with the company’s growth. And its popularity continued to
  grow. While Newton and Searcy handled the infrastructure needs, Drupal
  contributors were able to focus on the project, resulting in its size
  tripling following the move to the OSL. “Had the OSL not stepped up
  and offered hosting, we probably would have had to find hosting of our
  own and paid for it, which would have put too much financial burden on
  the project at the time and severely hampered the project,” says Jacob
  Redding, Drupal Association executive director. Over the next two
  years, students headed up an overhaul of Drupal’s infrastructure,
  adjusting solutions to meet rising growth and making Drupal more
  easily available for download around the world. Newton worked to
  optimize the database infrastructure, while Searcy used load balancers
  and multiple Web nodes to create a formidable Web architecture. When
  Rudy Grigar arrived as a student system administrator at the lab in
  2007, the crisis period had ended, but he was able to continue Newton
  and Searcy’s work, developing new features for Drupal and using
  automated tools to increase efficiency. “It didn't sink in until a few
  months before graduating from OSU how big Drupal was,” Grigar says. “I
  had the opportunity to attend DrupalCon San Francisco and witnessed
  just how large and global the Drupal community had become.” While they
  helped Drupal attain the stability needed to weather extreme growth
  successfully, Grigar says the experience of working on the project was
  equally valuable for the students involved. “The industry experience
  is priceless,” he says. “It's an amazing thing to be responsible for
  successes and failures as a student with something as popular as
  Drupal.” *Drupal servers at the Open Source Lab.*Now, Drupal has
  achieved both success and stability, and is one of the largest open
  source projects hosted by the OSL. While server overload is no longer
  a concern for Drupal, Redding says the association’s relationship with
  the OSL has continued to yield unexpected benefits, largely because of
  the lab’s commitment to training students through hands-on experience.
  “Over the years what the OSL has provided has been over and above just
  fair hosting,” Redding says. “It’s been a great environment where
  people can come in and learn about hosting and about open source
  projects. Had the OSL only provided hosting we would not have been
  able to get such great people to work on our team.” After working on
  the Drupal project at the OSL, Newton went on to work as an
  administrator in the Drupal Association, while Grigar spent time after
  graduation working on Drupal infrastructure through Tag1 Consulting
  and Acquia. “Without the OSL we wouldn't have had the opportunity to
  learn what we did,” Grigar says. “Not only were we able to help a
  project like Drupal grow as college students; we developed sought-
  after skill sets that we've used to spread Drupal and open source
  software to others.” Current student employees at the OSL continue to
  learn by maintaining projects like Drupal and by providing the more
  comprehensive support still needed by other projects that are in
  earlier stages of development. This service to growing projects,
  Redding says, is especially important within the open source
  community. “The OSL has always been an essential part of any project
  and has fostered the success and accelerated the growth of many open
  source projects,” Redding says. “It’s amazing that it exists. It’s
  almost necessary to have a service like the OSL; it’s a very rare,
  very respected resource.” Though Drupal has moved past the growing
  pains that brought it to the OSL, the relationship between the lab and
  the Drupal Association has deepened through mutual support. Dries
  Buytaert, the original creator and project lead for Drupal, serves on
  the OSL Advisory Council, and student employees gain experience by
  working on Drupal both at the OSL and as interns with Drupal and its
  partners.And the support the OSL offered to help Drupal reach success
  has had positive effects for the university as well. When the lab
  offered Drupal as a stable option, OSU began utilizing it for
  university websites. “The campus uses Drupal and benefits profoundly,”
  says OSL Director Curt Pederson. By switching to Drupal content
  management system and using open source tools for other needs
  including spam filtering and security, the university was able to save
  thousands of dollars initially, and continues to benefit from free and
  low-cost maintenance.The fact that Drupal no longer needs the
  intensive support services that were necessary when the project
  arrived at the OSL is part of the lab’s goal to foster the success of
  projects that will eventually be able to support themselves. According
  to Lance Albertson, OSL associate director of operations, the lab’s
  function to drive the growth of emerging projects is perfectly
  illustrated in the trajectory of Drupal. “We’ve had similar successes
  in the past such as our experience with Mozilla,” Albertson says.
  “They were in a bad position infrastructure-wise and our students at
  the time kicked in and helped them fix their issues. Many of those
  students and staff still work at Mozilla today in leading roles.
  Drupal is another great example of how the OSL helped a growing
  community expand, allowing them to focus on improving their project.
  Seeing the success and impact of the community around the world is the
  reason many of us at the lab love what we do.” As the lab works to
  promote the growth of the next generation of open source projects,
  Redding says he’s excited to see the collaboration between Drupal and
  the OSL continue to expand. “We’d love more people to get involved
  with our project and we’d love for them to come from OSU,” Redding
  says. “I think there are some really great opportunities there that
  you’re not going to get anywhere else. I can’t think of a single place
  in the world where you can get that kind of experience other than the
  OSL.” Media contact: Kayla Harr, `harrk@osuosl.org`_To learn more

`OSL in the Spotlight at Summer Conferences`_
---------------------------------------------
  Submitted by Kayla Harr on August 13, 2012 ` `_ The open source
  community is driven by the people who use, change and support open
  source software. This summer, members of the Open Source Lab staff
  enjoyed opportunities to connect with those people face-to-face at
  annual open source events. Lab staff and students attended the
  Portland conferences Open Source Bridge and O’Reilly Open Source
  Convention, where they presented talks, hosted a booth to represent
  the OSL and talked shop with everyone from recreational users to
  industry developers.“Conferences are a way to interface with our
  community; not only our users, but people who know of us and like what
  we do, we can hear from them things that they want,” says OSL
  Associate Director of Operations Lance Albertson. “It's just great to
  be able to interact with people.”To kick off the summer, Albertson and
  other staff members attended Open Source Bridge, a volunteer-supported
  conference held June 26-29 at the Eliot Center in downtown Portland.
  Hundreds of community members, corporate representatives and people
  thinking about and contributing to open source gathered to share ideas
  and discuss technology. The annual conference focuses on the theme of
  open source citizenship, bringing individuals from a number of
  sectors, programming languages and backgrounds together to collaborate
  on what they all have in common: open source.At Open Source Bridge,
  Albertson presented a talk on private cloud platforms, Project Manager
  Greg Lund-Chaix spoke about open source technologies in K-12 education
  and student developer Corbin Simpson presented to a crowded room of
  more than 50 people on translating lessons from esoteric programming
  languages into methods for improving common code bases. Lund-Chaix
  then teamed up with Senior System Administrator Rudy Grigar and Senior
  Software Engineer Ken Lett to deliver a multifaceted presentation on
  DevOps. The three spoke from different perspectives in open source
  development, management and hosting to communicate a unified message
  about how collaborative thinking between developers and operations
  managers can improve project success.“Developers and system operations
  people need to understand both sides to perform their jobs more
  effectively and collaborate for better end results,” Grigar said
  during the talk.Kenn Wilson, a contract developer based in Portland,
  said after attending the OSL’s DevOps talk that the concept of
  integrating systems and development work wasn’t new to him, but that
  Lund-Chaix, Grigar and Lett brought new ideas to his attention.“One
  thing I did find really interesting is using something like cloud
  computing to test your system,” Wilson says. “That’s something I’ve
  never thought of before, to test your systems rather than your
  code.”Talks presented by the OSL and others at Open Source Bridge,
  Wilson says, are significant contributions to communal and individual
  knowledge.“You can learn about things you weren’t aware of,” Wilson
  says. “It helps everybody here in a very tangible way.” Lund-Chaix,
  Lett and Grigar field questions after presenting on the benefits of
  collaboration between developers and system administrators. That
  commitment to supporting the open source community won Albertson the
  conference’s highest honor at its official party June 27. Albertson
  was presented with the Truly Outstanding Open Source Citizen award for
  his efforts to introduce students to open source technology and the
  OSL’s continued support of numerous open source projects.“I think it's
  awesome,” Albertson says of his award. “I was completely caught off
  guard but I think it's a great honor to be able to have that
  award.”Albertson says he is passionate about bringing students into
  the lab and exposing them to open source technology because he
  appreciates how strong of a resource the OSL can be for students.“When
  I went through school I wished I had an OSL, and now I get to provide
  the resource I so wished I had to all these amazing students,”
  Albertson says. “It’s a great feeling.”Former OSL student employee
  Brandon Phillips, who attended Open Source Bridge and delivered two of
  his own presentations, says Albertson was an apt choice for the Truly
  Outstanding Open Source Citizen award given his integral role within
  the lab.“Lance has been a solid and steady hand inside of the OSL for
  years now, and it is an important role given the huge scope of
  projects that the OSL helps keep up and on the Internet,” Phillips
  says. “It is a well-deserved award.”After wrapping up Open Source
  Bridge, OSL staff had only a few short weeks to prepare for OSCON.
  Hosted by O’Reilly Media at the Oregon Convention Center June 16-20,
  OSCON continued the conversation about open source software that began
  at Open Source Bridge, but — with more than 3,000 attendees — on a
  much larger scale.The OSL was among nearly 100 exhibitors at the
  conference expo, which featured top open source industry partners as
  well as many open source projects hosted by the OSL. Students and
  full-time staff interacted with visitors to the OSL’s booth throughout
  the conference, sharing information about the lab’s current projects,
  explaining the OSL’s innovative integration of student employees and
  enjoying the opportunity to connect with other open source
  enthusiasts. OSCON attendees at the Oregon Convention Center. “It was
  good to interact with the corporate world and meet people
  professionally,” says Dean Johnson, a sophomore who began working at
  the lab in June. “People were really grateful for our mirrors and what
  we do, and it was nice to feel like what I’m doing here is making a
  difference and helping the community.”Many stopped by the OSL booth
  simply to meet the students and staff members who have helped support
  their projects, facilitated their downloads or provided technical
  support in person. Todd Richmond, who works in information technology
  with Lincoln County, Ore., already knew about the OSL’s services, but
  visited the booth to say thank you.“I use the OSL’s FTP mirrors
  daily,” Richmond says. “I think it’s a tremendous service, not just
  for other universities and governments, but for everyone. Having a
  regional site like that where we can grab security updates and things
  like that is fantastic.” OSL staff and students greet OSL supporters,
  users and alumni at the lab's OSCON booth. While at OSCON, Albertson
  delivered a talk on private cloud computing, and all of the OSL
  members in attendance hosted a Birds of a Feather session to introduce
  interested conference attendees to the lab and to offer those who
  already follow the lab insight on how OSL infrastructure continues to
  develop and improve.As part of OSCON week, the lab also held its first
  alumni gathering in appreciation of the students and staff who helped
  the OSL become the resource that it is today. More than 40 of the
  people who have been part of the OSL story gathered to reconnect with
  old friends, celebrate the lab’s achievements and honor the first
  director of the OSL, Shay Dakan, who passed away just over a week
  before the conference began.At the alumni event, OSL Director Curt
  Pederson, who has been part of the lab’s work since its beginnings,
  offered his thoughts on the group of people who have fueled the OSL’s
  progress over the years and his hopes for the future. Pederson
  emphasized the lab’s pristine track record for turning out students
  who go on to great success in the technical industry, as evinced by
  the caliber of people, many of whom represented top companies
  including Google, Rackspace and Mozilla, who were in the room.“The
  alumni event reminded me of why we started the OSL nine years ago, and
  that the true value of our work comes from providing our students with
  real industry experience,” Pederson says. “Having 55 of our former
  students now in key roles across the open source community confirms
  that the most important thing we do for the community is mentor the
  next generation of open source leaders.”Media contact: Kayla Harr,

`OSL Advances With New Staff Members; Renewed Focus`_
-----------------------------------------------------
  Submitted by Kayla Harr on August 6, 2012 The Oregon State University
  Open Source Lab recently hired three new full-time staff members as
  part of a movement toward expansion as a self-supported campus entity.
  The additional staff members will provide comprehensive support in lab
  operations, allowing the OSL to increase student opportunities within
  the lab and improve the resources it can offer open source
  projects.The OSL is home to some of the most well-known open source
  projects in the world and facilitates more than 600,000 unique
  downloads each day. In addition to hosting external projects, the OSL
  also contributes to and develops open source software in-house and
  provides hosting for projects and Web infrastructure within the
  university. To support its efforts, the lab employs several qualified
  OSU students who gain professional experience managing open source
  projects, maintaining servers and providing customer and user
  support.Broadening the lab's staff, says Associate Director of
  Operations Lance Albertson, will allow the OSL to enhance its
  contributions in all of the above capacities, particularly by
  providing the professional staff to supervise more student workers,
  increasing productivity in the lab. “The goal is basically doing more,
  giving more students the experience and the exposure in our
  environment,” Albertson says. “Full-time staff is really there to help
  students along the way and augment them, and the new restructuring
  allows us to hire more students.” In addition to serving as mentors to
  student employees, the new staff members will fulfill integral roles
  developing programming code for the lab and maintaining the OSL's
  hosting and support services. Hiring new staff has filled some of the
  gaps left by the departure of several full-time OSL staff members
  within the last year, Albertson says, and also allows the lab to begin
  the process of integrating its development and hosting teams. “The
  idea is to have our students doing both the operations side of things
  and the development side of things to give them more experience,”
  Albertson says. “The development team supporting the hosting side of
  the OSL will also improve our hosting services because they will
  develop tools that will allow more automation, which means we can do
  more with less.” With this plan for collaboration in mind, Albertson
  says the new staff members were selected in part based on ability to
  adapt and diverse skill in both software development and systems
  administration.New Senior Software Engineer Ken Lett exemplifies the
  multifaceted experience Albertson described, coming to the OSL after
  spending over a decade in various positions on the OSU campus. Lett
  has worked as a systems administrator in the School of `Electrical
  Engineering and Computer Science`_, completed an undergraduate degree
  in physics as a student and worked with `Central Web Services`_ as a
  software developer. Lett joins the OSL as senior software developer.
  Rudy Grigar and Justin Dugger, who joined the lab as senior systems
  architects, bring varied experiences of their own to the OSL, both in
  the private sector and in educational settings. Grigar, who graduated
  from OSU in 2010, worked at the OSL as a student and went on to hold
  private-sector positions in systems engineering as well as operations
  management. Dugger has a background in educational technology
  services, having worked as an applications system administrator at
  `Kansas State University`_ and in source control management at Kansas'
  `Johnson County Community College`_.In addition to adding Lett, Grigar
  and Dugger to the ranks, the OSL is also undergoing internal staff
  reorganization to better address priorities within the lab. These
  changes include Albertson's promotion from senior systems architect to
  Associate Director of Operations – a move that allows him to use the
  knowledge he's developed while managing the OSL's hosting over the
  past five years to evaluate the lab's approach to hosting and
  development tasks and implement new methods to promote efficiency.
  Grigar, who worked in the OSL as a student, returns to the lab as
  senior systems architect. Project Manager Greg Lund-Chaix, who has
  spent the last several years working heavily on the Oregon Virtual
  School District, is also refocusing his efforts within the lab. Lund-
  Chaix will still be involved in the virtual school district project,
  but will pass some of those responsibilities to others, allowing him
  to participate more fully in lab infrastructure planning, customer
  relations and student mentoring.These staff changes accompany efforts
  to secure the lab as a sustainable entity and to refine outreach to
  private sector partners. To enhance OSL communications, Albertson has
  begun adding students to the lab with the establishment of a team of
  media and marketing students. These students will manage
  responsibilities that were assigned to one full-time outreach manager
  in the past but have been unattached since the staff member's
  departure. “I saw that it was really an important role to have in our
  organization, but we can certainly do it with students,” says
  Albertson, who doesn't shy away from giving students the opportunity
  to fulfill varied roles in the lab. Dugger is serving as a senior
  systems architect in the lab after working at Kansas State University.
  As OSL staff work to optimize the lab's resources and place more
  emphasis on the value of the student experience, close mentoring and
  expanded student responsibilities will be essential to success. All of
  the new staff members will contribute to student development as
  students and staff collaborate to strengthen the lab. Lett says he is
  particularly enthusiastic about the opportunity to support student
  growth and the benefits capable students can bring to the OSL. “When I
  worked with students in the School of Electrical Engineering and
  Computer Science, I saw that we had some really brilliant students,”
  Lett says. “That made me appreciate what a resource we have in our
  students. I'm excited to be part of the process of teaching and
  fostering that talent.” Media contact: Kayla Harr,

`Building a Bright Future With DevOps`_
---------------------------------------
  Submitted by Kayla Harr on August 2, 2012 ` `_ Sometimes finding the
  best solution means starting over. That was Mike Cooper’s dilemma as
  he tackled his first solo project at the Oregon State University Open
  Source Lab. An OSU sophomore studying computer science who had just
  been hired in March 2010 to work as a system administrator for the
  lab, he was tasked with securing a network connection that could be
  extended to laptops, allowing lab staff and hosted projects to connect
  to the lab's private network from anywhere. Cooper decided to scrap
  the previous method that others had planned to use to link the network
  servers and instead opted for a virtual private network, a transient
  link between servers that he felt was a better fit for the lab's
  needs. “When I started the project it was kind of hard for me to look
  at this and say ‘No, we should be doing something else’ and throw away
  all that work,” Cooper says.“But I decided that the approach they were
  taking wouldn't work very well for what we wanted.” Cooper felt sure
  that his proposed solution would be well suited to the lab’s needs.
  There was only one problem: He didn't have detailed enough knowledge
  of how the computers handle networking to complete the necessary steps
  to ensure the VPN was as effective and convenient as possible. “This
  was the first time I was working on something that people were going
  to use,” Cooper says. “If it was down to the point where I needed to
  learn this fairly complicated thing that usually you don't have to
  know for a project of my own, I probably would have gotten bored and
  wandered off to another project.” But that wasn't an option this time.
  Aware that his VPN design would be used by lab staff members as well
  as representatives from the open source projects the lab hosts
  (including worldwide leaders like Drupal, Apache and Linux), Cooper
  took the time to learn the complexities of the lab’s servers. With
  that knowledge, he was able to configure the VPN to operate in the
  exact capacity needed for the lab — a task he performed so well that
  the VPN is still in use today. “That was kind of my introduction to
  the OSL and what it means to have a professional-level service that
  you're running,” Cooper says. “I learned how our CFEngine system works
  and manages the servers, and I had take into consideration who our
  users are and what their needs are. I hadn’t done that before.” Over
  the next two years, Cooper continued to extend his professional
  knowledge as an OSL system administrator. He worked on servers, helped
  manage projects and communicated with representatives of hosted
  projects to resolve questions. As he gained experience with the lab,
  he also took on a mentoring role toward newer students, who he helped
  acclimate to the lab. “I've always been in a position where I like to
  teach people about technology, but doing it in a professional capacity
  definitely helped me grow,” Cooper says. For Cooper, collaborating
  with his peers and with professional staff members in the OSL was just
  as valuable as interacting with users and external project managers.
  “Being surrounded by experts,” he says, was both motivational and
  educational. “The contacts I made through the OSL really helped my
  education,” Cooper says. “The pace was much quicker than in classes
  because the pace is you learn as quickly as you can; not for the
  midterm next week. You don't wait to learn.” And that proactive
  perspective quickly helped Cooper find success outside of the lab as
  well. During the summer following his junior year, he landed an
  internship with ITA Software, a company that had just been acquired by
  Google. At ITA Software, Cooper worked in a development position,
  allowing him to round out the experience in system administration that
  he’d gained at the OSL.As he neared graduation this year, Cooper found
  his professional skills were so comprehensive that he was able to not
  only successfully interview for a job with Mozilla, but was offered a
  position as a Web developer, even though the bulk of his experience
  was in system administration. “During the interview process I actually
  found that my experience as a system administrator was very useful; I
  could draw on my experience as a system administrator to answer
  questions in a way they liked,” Cooper says. “It’s experience that
  most Web developers wouldn’t have. I know that without the OSL, I
  probably would not have gotten that job.” Switching to development in
  his career was another instance when Cooper recognized that his best
  option was to take a new approach. “I enjoy system administration, but
  I enjoy development more,” he says. For Cooper, finding work
  immediately after graduation in the field he is passionate about is a
  rewarding result of his experience at the OSL and the work he’s done
  over the last two years. The unique environment of the lab, he says,
  helps students find uncommon success. “It's probably been one of the
  best experiences that I've had so far, and it's probably the single
  most beneficial thing I've done as far as my career and my personal
  learning,” Cooper says. “Being in contact with a real environment and
  having permission to work autonomously is something that students
  don't usually get. We have a particular level of responsibility and a
  particular level of trust and that helps us grow.” Media contact:

`Connect With the OSL at OSCON 2012`_
-------------------------------------
  Submitted by Kayla Harr on July 11, 2012 Staff members and students
  from the Oregon State University Open Source Lab will represent the
  lab at Portland’s O’Reilly Open Source Convention (OSCON) July 16-20.
  An annual open source conference, OSCON engages all aspects of the
  open source community with sessions, tutorials, keynote presentations
  and an expo.The OSL will be present throughout the conference at the
  OSCON Expo, where the lab will have a booth alongside open source
  leaders like Drupal, Facebook and Intel. In addition, OSL Associate
  Director of Operations Lance Albertson will lead a session on open
  source private cloud platforms. Albertson plans to discuss the various
  features offered by different cloud computing platforms and offer
  insight on how to choose a platform that best meets a project’s
  needs.Those interested in learning more about the OSL will have the
  opportunity to meet members of the lab’s staff and familiarize
  themselves with lab operations at the OSL’s Birds of a Feather (BoF)

`Setting The Bar High`_
-----------------------
  Submitted by Kayla Harr on May 10, 2012 Recap of Beaver Barcamp 9 ` `_
  The Oregon State University Open Source Lab’s `Beaver BarCamp 9`_
  brought around 70 people to the Kelley Engineering Center on April 21
  to discuss projects, explore new interests and share ideas. The
  sessions held throughout the day varied greatly in topic — from
  robotics to hydroponic gardening to gaming — but all shared an open
  forum and flexibility that promoted discussion and collaborative
  learning.In Daniel Miller’s session, Indoor Hydroponic Gardening, he
  used diagrams and photos to demonstrate how he built a hydroponic
  gardening structure in his small room using materials purchased at a
  home improvement store. Nearly all of the 10 people who attended
  Miller’s session spoke at least once, asking for clarification about
  his methods, offering suggestions on how to improve the structure and
  even giving Miller ideas about what to make once the tomatoes he is
  cultivating are ripe. The most popular suggestions? Pizza and salsa.
  “I started doing indoor hydroponics just a couple months ago,” says
  Miller, a junior in electrical engineering and computer science. “So
  some of the input I got was good, like the idea of buying pipes at an
  irrigation store. You give and you get information here.” Attendees
  brought expertise in a variety of fields, culminating in immersive
  discussions both in and between sessions. When one member of a session
  group didn’t understand a concept, other attendees would assist the
  presenter in using a different frame of thinking to communicate ideas.
  Soo-Hyun Yoo, far left, answers questions about the robot- operating-
  system-controlled robots he built and programmed. Soo Hyun-Yoo, a
  freshman in computer science, presented his two robot-operating-
  system-controlled robots in his session, explaining how the ROS
  software runs his robots and demonstrating their movement with a
  joystick tripod he built himself. Hyun-Yoo, who has worked on his
  robots for 18 months, says sharing a project with others can provide
  helpful insights to the presenter as well as the audience. “It’s nice
  to have other people to bounce ideas off of, just a fresh set of eyes
  to find problems you don’t see yourself,” Hyun-Yoo says. This
  collaborative spirit is much the inspiration for BarCamp and its
  spontaneous nature. Sessions at BarCamp can be presented by anyone on
  any topic, and were proposed throughout the day by attendees who wrote
  their topic on colorful cards and taped it onto the event schedule.
  Participants were invited to follow their interests and attend
  whichever sessions caught their attention. While computer science and
  programming remained the interests shared by most BarCamp attendees,
  the diverse sessions allowed people to apply that interest to a wide
  range of topics. Members of Portland State University’s Computer
  Action Team present and demonstrate the automation software Puppet. In
  one session, representatives from `Portland State University`_ took to
  a KEC classroom to discuss the `PSU Computer Action Team’s`_ use of
  Puppet automation software and detailed how others could effectively
  utilize Puppet in system administration. Simultaneously, a radically
  different session was taking place on the lawn outside the building:
  How to Find Four-Leaf Clovers. Open Source Lab Developer Emily Dunham,
  center, and student Nick Snowhill search for four-leaf clovers with
  guidance from student Amanda Abbot, right. Amanda Abbott, a junior in
  chemistry, led the session, in which she instructed her participants
  in how to recognize a four-leaf clover in a dense patch of clovers and
  grass. Abbott has been regularly finding four-leaf clovers since
  elementary school, she says, and quickly discovered several in the
  grass near the KEC front entrance. “The best piece of advice is to
  find the thing that’s not a three-leaf clover,” Abbott says. While
  searching for clovers, OSL Developer Emily Dunham reflected on how the
  process could be likened to the methods programmers use to teach
  machines to recognize objects. The strategy of finding the object that
  doesn’t belong, Dunham says, is similar to how one would program a
  computer to identify four-leaf clovers. “I like the tools that
  computer science gives you for breaking things down and understanding
  the way a problem is solved,” Dunham says. “Because if you can explain
  something to a computer, you can explain it to anyone.” The impromptu
  application of technical thinking to other subjects prevailed during
  breaks between sessions and during the BarCamp lunch hour. While
  enjoying refreshments, participants took advantage of the opportunity
  to talk about new technologies and best practices in everything from
  programming to education.In addition to learning about each other’s
  interests, BarCamp participants also had the opportunity to attend a
  presentation from OSL Associate Director of Operations Lance Albertson
  about the lab’s projects and infrastructure. Following the
  presentation, which addressed what the OSL offers, how lab staff
  manage projects and why the lab utilizes particular organization
  schemes and materials over others, attendees were invited on a tour of
  the lab. According to Albertson, being able to bring interested
  community members into the lab and give people who may use software
  the OSL hosts the opportunity to see the physical location is part of
  what makes Beaver BarCamp a unique and valuable event for the lab.
  “It's a way for us to directly interface with the local community,”
  Albertson says. “It also gives us a chance to meet other students that
  might potentially be interested in working with us and have face to
  face conversations with them.” For most participants, the relaxed
  environment and diversity of topics at Beaver BarCamp are what make
  the event most enjoyable. Mark Overholser, who has attended BarCamp
  regularly since 2009, says he continues to come because the sessions
  are unpredictable but always worthwhile. “You never know what is going
  to happen but you show up because there’s bound to be something
  interesting,” Overholser says. “People get together and talk, share
  ideas, and you learn things you may not have thought of before. You
  have to take it on faith that there is going to be something great.”
  `Beaver BarCamp`_ is hosted semiannually by the OSL, which hosts some
  of the most well known open source projects in the world and
  facilitates more than 600,000 unique downloads daily around the world.
  The OSL presents Beaver BarCamp to promote idea sharing, collaboration
  and open source innovation, and will return with Beaver BarCamp 10

`Open Source, Open Future`_
---------------------------
Submitted by Kayla Harr on May 10, 2012 Students reap the benefits of
professional programming experience at the OSU Open Source Lab


As a freshman at `Oregon State University`_ in early 2010, Jordan
Evans didn't have a lot of computer science experience. Though he had
always had an interest in computers, Evans had come to OSU as a
mathematics major and, like many first-year students, didn't yet have
a clear idea of what he hoped to do with his education. “I decided I
liked math classes better than I liked computer science classes, so I
kept taking math classes,” Evans says. “I really had no idea what I
would do with it. I knew what I liked but I didn’t know how to apply
that to anything.” Two years later, Evans' career goals have undergone
a radical change. Since June 2010, Evans has worked at OSU's Open
Source Lab, where he’s built up an impressive resume that includes two
years of professional experience as a system administrator, a summer
internship with Google and knowledge of exactly what he wants to do in
the future. “I think the OSL kind of shaped my interests,” Evans says.
“Working here gives us a practical application for everything that
we’re doing in classes.” Evans is one of 12 students working at the
lab, which provides hosting and support services to some of the most
well-known open source projects in the world. Students work alongside
professional staff members to maintain servers, write program code and
provide technical support for the software the OSL hosts.While the lab
fulfills a valuable role at OSU by hosting various projects and
helping the university reduce costs through open source software
alternatives, its services make an even bigger impact on a worldwide
scale, enabling more than 600,000 downloads daily and contributing to
software like the `Drupal content management system`_, `Apache Web
server`_ and `Linux operating system`_ that individuals, start-up
businesses and organizations around the globe use every day.


Code for success
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
But the OSL's greatest impact may be the ubiquitous effect it has on
the students who spend years of their college careers learning and
working in the lab. Nearly all of the students who have worked at the
lab since its inception in 2003 have gone on to find immediate success
in the technical world after graduation, founding start-up companies,
receiving job offers from top software companies and enjoying the
opportunity to define their own professional paths.With graduates at
companies like `Google`_ and `Mozilla`_, as well as at the helm of
several successful start-up companies, the OSL has a habit of
producing students who are prepared to skyrocket through the industry.
The advantage, says `Alex Polvi`_, an OSU alumnus who worked at the
OSL throughout his college years, is the foundation of practical
experience students are allowed to build in the lab. “The critical
part is real-world experience, solving problems for actual customers
with skills that are needed in the real world,” Polvi says. “You’re
going to graduate with a job from here and have a real career path.”
Polvi experienced firsthand the powerful impact a few years at the OSL
can have on a developing career. While working at the OSL, he
completed internships with Google and Mozilla. During his senior year
he worked for Mozilla remotely from OSU, and the company offered him a
job immediately after graduation. Polvi and two other OSU alums went
on to form `Cloudkick`_, a startup that drew several million dollars
from investors before being purchased by a larger company. “I do not
hesitate at all saying that my success is 100 percent because of the
OSL,” Polvi says. “They set me up to have a successful career. Without
that, I don’t know what I’d be doing.”


A blend of mentorship and independence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As a system administrator, Evans largely determines his own projects
and has the experience and the knowledge to solve most of his own
problems. While students receive a great amount of training from
professional staff during their first several months at the lab, Evans
says students who have been at the lab longer become mentors
themselves, helping new students familiarize themselves with the work.
“We’re still learning a lot, but we’re also able to teach others,”
Evans says. “That really solidifies what we’ve learned. If we’re able
to teach it to someone new and pass on that same knowledge, then we’ve
definitely come to a point where we understand the skills and the
technical knowledge required.” That shift in responsibilities is part
of the process OSL Associate Director of Operations `Lance Albertson`_
hopes to provide students with throughout their time in the lab.
Albertson gives students increasing levels of independence as they
progress and lets them tackle problems on their own, offering support
when they need it but first allowing them the opportunity to succeed
without his help. “I make sure they have ownership of something,”
Albertson says. “I try not to manage what they do as much as I can. If
I give them a big project they usually take it on and they will
immerse themselves.” According to Evans, the benefit of working
independently as well as being responsible for collaborating with
other students and the individuals who rely on OSL services goes
beyond developing the competence to succeed in a professional
environment. “I think it’s shaped me to do really well because it's
taught me not only how to work in the field, but how to work with
other people in the field,” Evans says. “In our job we have to reach
out and communicate about projects, and it’s taught me to keep an open
mind and to not be afraid to seek out a mentor in skills that I don’t
have.”


Graduating with an edge
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  The OSL has continued to expand and play a significant role in the
  open source community in recent years, and currently provides at
  `least 160 projects`_ with various support services. Its contributions
  to the largest open source projects in the world include not only
  technical support but graduates who leave school uniquely prepared to
  benefit their future employers. According to Polvi, such students are
  an important resource in a rapidly growing industry. “The Open Source
  Lab is churning out students who are probably the most highly skilled
  people seen coming out of these education systems,” Polvi says. “We
  need more technical people and more students who can go out and get
  jobs, and this is such a great model for that.” Recognizing the value
  of the lab, leaders in the industry have responded with support that
  has made it possible for the lab to take on more projects. Further
  industry partnerships, Albertson says, are essential to allow the lab
  to offer professional experiences to even more students. “We basically
  give them a full work experience from the beginning, covering all the
  facets,” Albertson says. “Not only do they build technical skills,
  they build personal skills, they build professional skills and they
  have something tangible when they leave OSU other than a diploma.”
  Evans says he didn't understand how much of an impact working at the
  OSL would have on his future until he started applying for internships
  and realized how many opportunities were open to him because of his
  position at the lab. Now, he’s grateful for the advantage of working
  as a system administrator while earning his degree, and looks forward
  to that experience bringing him more opportunities in the future.
  “This really distinguishes us from other college students," Evans
  says. "They might have taken all the same classes we did, but we can
  put on our resume ‘I’ve already been doing this job for the past three
  years.’ That kind of trumps most things you can have on your resume at
  this point.” Media contact: Kayla Harr, `harrk@osuosl.org`_To support

`OSL ‘Unconference’ Approaches`_
--------------------------------
  Submitted by Kayla Harr on April 3, 2012 The Oregon State University
  Open Source Lab will host Beaver BarCamp 9 Saturday, April 21, in the
  Kelley Engineering Center. The event is free and open to anyone,
  including OSU students of all majors and interests, faculty and
  community members. Beaver BarCamp is an opportunity to learn about an
  assortment of projects, skills and interests through discussion in an
  open, participant-led format. Attendees are invited to devise and lead
  interactive sessions that others at the conference can join. In the
  past, BarCamp sessions have focused both on computer and software
  development and on completely non-technical subjects. Topics have
  included writing software applications, learning Spanish, screenplay
  writing, the computer science gender gap, improving Web security and
  biking, among others. BarCamps are often described as “unconferences”
  that blend the informational element of a conference with an informal
  and participatory philosophy. Instead of lectures and presentations,
  BarCamp attendees can expect to learn and share their own knowledge
  through discussions and activities. BarCamp sessions will be held from
  10 a.m. to 7 p.m., but participants can attend any portion of the day
  to join upcoming sessions. Those who are interested in presenting a
  talk can propose their sessions at any time throughout the day, though
  arriving at the beginning of the event to add a session to the
  schedule is encouraged for maximum participation. Refreshments will be
  provided. The OSL hosts Beaver BarCamp semiannually with events in the
  spring and fall to engage the OSU and Corvallis community in creative
  discussion and collaboration. The lab is home to more than 160 open
  source projects and facilitates more than 600,000 unique downloads
  each day. To support its efforts, the lab employs several qualified
  OSU students who gain professional experience managing open source
  projects, maintaining servers and providing support to the open source
  projects the OSL hosts. Many of those students will present sessions
  at Beaver BarCamp to share the knowledge and technical skills they've
  developed through their work at the OSL.For more information on Beaver

`Twitter`_, you may have seen some of this great news stream by
already. But we do have some great new photos to share, so read on in
any case.The first ever `Linux Learners Day`_ was a resounding
success. We welcomed more than 35 student participants to this day
long track on all things Linux and open source. The best part of the
day? Letting our attendees know that we could forgo the concluding
panel session on careers if they were tired from 5+ hours of lecture
and having them not only decline to leave early, but then keep the
panel discussion going a full twenty minutes over schedule because of
all the great questions.

`New Study to Investigate Use of Open Source Software for Securing the
Energy Industry`_
-----------------
  Submitted by OSUOSL Admin on August 7, 2011 Energy Sector Security
  Consortium and the Oregon State University Open Source Lab Partner to
  Establish Effective and Inclusive Collaboration and Governance Models
  8-8-2011CORVALLIS, Oregon - The Energy Sector Security Consortium
  (EnergySec) and Oregon State University’s Open Source Lab (OSUOSL)
  announced today that they will partner to perform strategic research
  on the current use of open source software in the energy sector,
  especially as it relates to computer security. OSUOSL will perform
  case studies looking at leading and influential organizations or
  projects, the tools they use and the challenges these groups have
  faced in adopting open source software.“We are excited to be working
  with Oregon State University’s Open Source Lab on this project.” said
  Steven Parker, Vice President of Technology Research and Projects for
  EnergySec. “With their earned reputation as a trusted, independent
  institution with expertise in open source software, we expect their
  findings will provide us with objective information regarding the use
  of open source technology in the energy community. This will allow us
  to better inform and serve our member organizations.”The project is
  designed to provide EnergySec with baseline data on the use of open
  source software in the energy sector, especially within the area of
  cybersecurity, and to produce an inventory of the experienced
  companies and groups in this space. The aim is to build up a
  significant body of knowledge regarding how and why energy companies
  and groups participate in open source, both as users and as
  contributors.“It is exciting for us to extend our research agenda and
  explore how open source software may offer new and exciting solutions
  to this vital sector” stated Curt Pederson, OSUOSL director. Pederson,
  whose early career included work in the energy industry, will guide
  the project team as it also explores ways to use open source practices
  to build a more cohesive community for solving the energy industry’s

`A Little Love for the LUG`_
----------------------------
Submitted by OSUOSL Admin on August 3, 2011 The Oregon State
University Linux Users Group (`LUG`_) exists to promote free and open
source software on campus. Its members and moderators turn to events
like `OSCON`_ to find support from premier open source affiliates to
help boost the group’s reputability at Oregon State University, and
last week some OSU Open Source Lab (`OSL`_) students also LUG
members were treated to mass donations.An incredible 23 organizations
and companies listed below opened their booths and handed the
students boxes of t-shirts, books and other great gifts to help the
LUG’s development this coming year.


The OSU LUG Cannot Live on OSL Goodies Alone
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
  “At the start of the school year, you have a bunch of freshmen coming
  in being pulled left and right by all these different organizations,”
  said Emily Dunham, a sophomore developer at the OSL and LUG member.
  “We want to give the students more encouragement to try the Linux
  Users Group; see if getting involved with open source is something
  that interests them. We picked up quite a bit of stuff in that
  interest.”While LUG moderators will use t-shirts, stickers and the
  like to entice new members and create an eventful atmosphere during
  meetings, they also will utilize the large quantities of books and
  magazines organizations provided for educational means. No Starch
  Press, for example, donated critical material like How Linux Works,
  Book of Inkscape, Essential Blender and Ubuntu for Non-Geeks. MongoDB,
  ARIN, SourceGear and Linux Magazine also gave armfuls of useful
  resources.“We so sincerely appreciate their commitment to helping our
  assistance to the community,” Dunham said. “These aren’t necessarily
  the biggest companies and don’t necessarily have a lot of stuff to
  give away, and yet they shared with us what they thought would
  help.”The moderators are excited about this upcoming year. They hope
  to reenergize the LUG, and the donations will certainly play a major
  role in doing so.From the OSL and the OSU LUG, thank you to the
  following organizations for their amazing contributions!

`Highlights from OSCON 2011`_
-----------------------------
Submitted by OSUOSL Admin on August 1, 2011 Summer Camp for Geeks
Students at the Oregon State University Open Source Lab (`OSL`_) get
into a project development groove, especially during the summer
months. They’re happy to exit the groove, though, when major open
source events roll into the region.

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A group of them took a break from their daily routines and traveled to
the Oregon Convention Center in Portland last week for `OSCON`_, now
in its 13th year. Amidst dozens of booths, each with its own
ornamentation – simple and extravagant – they wandered, hunting for
stickers, branded flashlights and other free promotional garb, when
they weren’t tending to the OSL’s own booth. Thousands of attendees
flocked to the many sessions and tutorials. The OSUOSL’s Lead Systems
Administrator and Infrastructure Architect `Lance Alberson`_ alongside
Lead Software Engineer `Peter Krenesky`_ led one of each. The first
was a tutorial, `Hands on Virtualization with Ganeti`_, and
Wednesday’s session was `Ganeti Web Manager: Cluster Management Made
Simple`_.Meanwhile, the students jumped from booth to booth with the
masses to learn about new projects, startups and open source
initiatives within large companies like Facebook, Google and Intel.
The Lab’s OSCON newcomers like freshmen Emily Dunham and Alan Sherman
were surprised by the varied relationships between attendees and the
open source community.

“I found it a bit interesting to get an idea of what the end users are
like,” Dunham said. “It was a much more corporate image than what I
previously associated with open source, but it’s a good reminder that
it really is for everyone.”


Alan Sherman and John Hawley Rocked the Softlayer Server Challenge The
challenge? Repopulate 20 drive bays and plug in 3 sets of 6 network
cables into their respective switch in as short a time as possible.

Both Dunham and OSUOSL Outreach Manager `Leslie Hawthorn`_ attended a
special part of the Google-sponsored lunch on Wednesday. It recognized
women in the open source community.“I got to meet some really cool
people there,” Dunham said. “It’s always kind of nice to know that
being in a minority doesn’t mean you’re the only one.”For Corbin
Simpson, one of the OSL’s veteran students and OSCON returner, the
best part of the convention was the individual “birds of feather”
sessions, held after hours.“They provide good opportunity for
community members to actually discuss things without the format of the
expo hall or the tutorials,” he said. “It’s really cool that they
provided that space and that time for that.”

When they weren’t migrating to different spots, the students helped
operate the OSL booth, complete with `Ganeti Web Manager`_ for users
to demo.Candid as students often are, they admitted their Lab pitch to
passersby became rather familiar. They appreciated the repetition,
which in turn improved their knowledge of the Lab itself.“Figuring out
what aspects of the OSL people are interested, and seeing just how
many people had heard of it before gives me a lot better perspective
of our place in the community,” Dunham said. “There are aspects of it
that are kind of surprising. It’s surprising how many people haven’t
heard of us, but then again it was really nice to see how many of the
booths had a little OSL sign on their table saying, ‘We’re hosted
here.’”The OSL’s impact on the community – the global OSCON community
– was obvious. Students and professionals working together, in
addition to supplying world-class services for projects of varying
popularity levels and directions, the Lab held its own amongst large-
scale corporations.“I think what the OSL does is remarkably important
and is possibly the most important thing done at OSCON,” Simpson said.

`Come See the OSUOSL at OSCON 2011`_
------------------------------------
Submitted by OSUOSL Admin on July 22, 2011 ` `_It's that time of year
again in Portland, Oregon. It's sunny and warm — well, it is today —
and the annual `OSCON`_ conference is just around the corner. The `OSU
Open Source Lab`_ team will be participating in several activities at
the conference, and we hope to meet some new folks, introduce them to
the lab and our offerings to the open source community, and catch up
with old friends. Here's what we're up to at OSCON 2011:


Community Leadership Summit

`OSL talks OSWALD and Ganeti at Open Source Bridge`_
----------------------------------------------------
  Submitted by OSUOSL Admin on July 22, 2011 Three representatives of
  the Open Source Lab gave presentations at last week's `Open Source
  Bridge conference`_ in Portland.The annual four-day conference is a
  public platform for open source developers to discuss various
  technologies and projects. Hundreds of people filed in each day to
  listen to the individual talks and share information with the open
  source community.Programmer Tim Harder gave the first of the two OSL
  project presentations on Tuesday afternoon, while lead systems
  administrator/architect Lance Albertson with lead software engineer
  Peter Krenesky presented on Wednesday morning.Harder's presentation,
  Lessons from and for the Open Hardware Movement (`Slides - PDF`_),
  attracted two dozen attendees. The talk included an overview of
  `OSWALD`_ (Oregon State Wireless Active Learning Device) and
  observations from its time as an educational tool for students.The OSL
  developed OSWALD to help give Computer Science students at OSU hands-
  on experience in class. Freshmen students were given the device to
  modify; it was inexpensive, had the latest in technology from the
  mobile space, and was completely open for development. The project met
  some problems, including ones spurred by varied classroom experiences,
  support requirements, and students with different experience
  levels.OSWALD is suspended for now, until funds are collected and a
  new platform is discovered. But it’s an important learning tool for
  students, which is why the OSL has analyzed the problems in order to
  make the next device better suited for the college environment. "I
  think it's good to continue pushing for an open platform or something
  that students can do that’s actually related to real-world
  applications," Harder said.Harder, who handled much of the software
  development, says he hopes companies look at this type of project and
  want to help – mostly through supplying components – because it gets
  students familiarized with the same types of technology they would
  work with in the professional environment. OSWALD and future devices
  like it are advantageous not just for students, but for companies
  where those same students might work after graduation.On the second
  day of OS Bridge, Albertson and Krenesky gave their presentation,
  Hands-on Virtualization with Ganeti (`Slides - PDF`_). Ganeti, an open
  source virtualization management tool developed by Google, is the
  launching point for Ganeti Web Manager (GWM), a web application that
  allows administrators and clients to access their Ganeti clusters.
  Many OSL members are part of GWM's development – both students and
  full-time staff. The tool is still in its early stages, but it's
  growing. Wednesday marked the second year Albertson gave a
  presentation at OS Bridge about Ganeti; last year, it was about what
  it is; this year, it was about how to install and use it, and what the
  OSL has added to the project, in this case GWM."(Ganeti) is active,"
  Albertson said. "There are lots of new features. There are community
  contributions. There have been several large patches on the Ganeti
  proper project that we included."The OSL is taking some simple
  approaches to promoting GWM, like attending conferences, blogging, and
  talking to people about it. In terms of its function, increased setup
  ease has helped its popularity."One of the big things that we've done
  is make it easier to get the project up and running, not just for end
  users but for developers," Krenesky said. "If it's going to take you
  hours to get it set up, you're going to turn people off long before
  they even open a source file, and you don't want that.""Everything's
  preconfigured. You just download it and it does most of it for
  you."Photos by `Reid Beels`_ - Used under `Creative Commons License`_

`OSUOSL Alum Eric Searcy Joins the Linux Foundation as IT
Infrastructure Manager`_
------------------------
  Submitted by OSUOSL Admin on July 6, 2011 Eric Searcy, a former three-
  year student employee at the `Open Source Lab`_, has picked up a new
  role at the `Linux Foundation`_ as the organization’s IT
  Infrastructure Manager. He will be in charge of maintaining and
  deploying systems, systems security, and keeping the Foundation's IT
  infrastructure up and running. In Spring 2008, Searcy graduated from
  `Oregon State University`_ with a degree in Computer Science. He
  immediately began working for Corvallis-based InsightsNow, a market
  research company, as its Infrastructure Architect. He was hired by
  Jason McKerr, then InsightsNow's Director of Technology and one of two
  people who founded the OSUOSL. If you've been following the news from
  Oregon's tech scene, you may recall that McKerr `recently joined`_
  Portland based startup `Puppet Labs`_ as VP of Development.Taking the
  job at the Linux Foundation was an easy decision for Searcy. He gained
  valuable experience during his three years at InsightsNow and worked
  with some open software, but he says working for the Foundation means
  making an impact on the community he cares about."It wasn’t like being
  at the OSL, which is a key player in the open source sphere,” Searcy
  said. “Looking at this job [at the Linux Foundation], I see myself
  back to being able to be part of that."“And it’s not just about
  increasing my industry exposure. It’s having more direct influence on
  helping open source.”During his time at the OSL, Searcy headed a roll-
  out of the centralized configuration management system – a year-
  and-a-half long project. He was also responsible for the web servers
  for Drupal.org and the OSL's monitoring and authentication systems.“It
  basically was three years of industry experience,” he said. “Being at
  the OSL was a larger experience than I would have gotten anywhere
  else. Even if I had gone into an internship [elsewhere], then you
  don’t get put in charge of the important things.”The OSL hosts the
  Linux Foundation’s infrastructure including websites, email, and
  development machines.

`Emily on Essentials: Robotics, Open Source and Life as New Student at
the OSL`_
---------
Submitted by OSUOSL Admin on June 3, 2011 Ed. Note: As part of our
ongoing series of interviews with the OSL's student employees, this
week we're bringing you the story of Emily Dunham, one the newest
additions to the OSL. Emily joined us just over a month ago as a
student developer. Emily was kind enough to share her thoughts with
the Lab's student writer, Anthony Casson.


Emily hard at work on her latest creation, which fetched the Artistic
Design award at this year's `Oregon State University Engineering
Expo`_
;;;;;;
  **What year are you at Oregon State University?**I’m a freshman in
  computer science in the Honors College. **How was the transition from
  high school to college in Computer Science?**The independence has been
  a whole lot of fun. But college has really exceeded my expectations.
  The classes, especially the Honors classes, are really good; the
  teachers really care about the students’ personal development,
  learning, and involvement. And I’ve had some awesome teaching
  assistants in my labs. **You’ve been going to Beaver BarCamps since
  you were a high school student in Corvallis’ neighbor, Philomath. What
  keeps you coming back?**BarCamp is fascinating just for the totally
  different paradigm of it. I had an opportunity to attend a normal
  conference as part of the `Intel Learning Company`_, the freshman open
  source group that I’m involved with. After having done that, I started
  appreciating how unique BarCamp really is. **How did you get a spot on
  the OSL team?**I attended one of their sessions about being a systems
  administrator, and then spoke with the people who made that
  presentation afterwards about what I’m interested in and how it’s
  similar to a student job I held in high school. They invited me to
  apply, and so I applied; I interviewed. They told me I had gotten the
  job by the end of the week, and I started the next Monday. **What
  interested you about the OSL?**For a long time, I didn’t really know
  what the OSL was—didn’t know it was here—but I started hearing about
  it in various newsletters that go out to students, and at BarCamp. I
  started looking around. Almost every time I installed an application
  in Ubuntu I thought, ‘Okay, that comes from OSU OSL; that’s what that
  place is.’ I started paying attention to the neat things it does, the
  ways it’s involved, and then realized it seemed like a really cool
  place. After meeting the people here—they’re just really great people
  to work with because they absolutely love learning, and that’s why
  they’re in it. **How has working in your new position been so far?**On
  the Friday before I started work, I was talking to `Rob McGuire-Dale`_
  and he said, ‘It’s a great job. It’s a really great job. It’s the best
  student job on campus, but be warned: the first week is just a fire
  hose of information.’ Everybody, though, really seems to enjoy
  teaching; I never feel like a question is stupid, and people are
  always helpful about where I can go to learn things—how I should
  approach them—they’re always happy to answer my questions. I’ve been
  learning really fast; I’ve been thrown into the middle of this `Ganeti
  Web Manager`_ framework, which is a mix of several languages I hadn’t
  worked with very extensively in the past. So it’s just been
  fascinating untangling it all. **What are some skills you bring to the
  OSL?**I personally feel like one of my unique skills is the ability to
  communicate—to translate ‘geek’ into English, almost—to write
  documentation for non-experts. **What are you hoping to get from your
  time at the OSL?**First off, during school, my classes make me
  realize, ‘Oh, it would be so cool to do something like that. It would
  be so cool to learn that language. It would be so cool to work on a
  programming project.’ But I never really take the time to do that. So
  on a personal level, the OSL is forcing me to take the time to learn
  new languages, learn the intricacies of how a certain computer, a
  certain software system works. And on the professional level, I could
  graduate here with three years of professional software development
  experience, and that is just a phenomenal opportunity. **Has anyone in
  particular helped you along during the first few weeks?**One person
  who has almost always been in the office when I am is `Corbin
  Simpson`_, and he really enjoys teaching. He made a point that I
  understand the basics and how Python works. He really went out of his
  way to figure out what I know so far and point out specifics of what
  someone of my exact knowledge will need to be aware of about the new
  languages. He’s been extremely helpful. **Does the OSL push you to
  develop your abilities, and does it help you learn new ones?**I feel
  like their top priority is not just to get x number of lines of code
  written in a day. Their top priority is for everyone who works here to
  come out as a better software developer, even if they’re the best
  software developers around. They’re very interested in my learning.
  It’s just a whole lot of fun to work with everyone. Many thanks to
  Emily and Anthony for this interview! Category: `Student Interviews`_

Submitted by Lance Albertson on April 29, 2011


The OSL Team and Our Host, David Recordon, at Facebook's Prineville
Data Center
;;;;;;;;;;;
We've been spending the past few weeks making our plans for the
summer: specing out longer term projects for our student employees,
sharing our knowledge at conferences and continuing our mission to
grow and support the world of open source. While we're busy looking
forward and reviewing our progress thus far for 2011, we thought it
would be the perfect time to bring the community an update on what
we've been up to for the past few months since our `last newsletter`_.
If you'd like to receive more frequent news updates from the OSL,
`follow us on Twitter`_ or `find us on Facebook`_.


Thanks to Our Sponsors
----------------------
Before we share our good news, we want to take a moment to express our
sincerest thanks to our sponsors. Without the support of our generous
donors, the OSL would not be able to provide support and services to
our `hosted communities`_. If you or your company would like to join
our list of supporters, please visit our `Donations information
page`_.It's always wonderful to see the successes of the OSL's alums,
and we've seen many of our former student employees go on to great
things: founding their own startups, opening boutique consulting shops
and landing roles at high profile open source companies like Mozilla.
We're particularly proud of one of the lab's first student employees,
`Alex Polvi`_, whose company `Cloudkick was recently acquired by
Rackspace`_. In true open source fashion, Alex has given back to the
lab through his Silver sponsorship of the OSL and sharing his
infectious enthusiasm for our plans to create open source boot camps
at Oregon State University. Many thanks to Alex for his support and
our best wishes for all his future endeavors.Our friends at the
`CiviCRM`_ project have once again joined us as Bronze sponsors for
2011. One of the best parts of our job at the OSL is providing support
to the many open source projects that empower other organizations to
do their good work, and CiviCRM does just that by providing
constituent management software for advocacy, non-profit and non-
governmental groups. We are proud to host CiviCRM and send our thanks
to them for their continued support.Finally, a **great big thank you**
to Google. Google has renewed their Platinum sponsorship in the lab
for 2011, continuing their tradition of support for the lab since its
inception. Google has donated more than one million dollars to the OSL
and we are grateful for their generous support and the opportunity to
participate in its open source programs for students, `Google Summer
of Code`_ and `Google Code-In`_.


Facebook, the OSL and Supercell
-------------------------------
The entire OSL crew was recently invited to tour Facebook's `Open
Compute Data Center`_ in Prineville, Oregon. Needless to say, it was
an incredible experience for the team. You can read all about our
adventure and see more photos from the data center on the `OSL news
page`_. You may recall our `recent announcement of the Supercell
project`_, our new on demand virtualization and continuous integration
resource, made possible by a generous grant from Facebook's Open
Source Team. Our early testers are up and running on Supercell and our
first report from the field has come in from the Drupal project. You

`Visiting Prineville: OSL Tours Facebook's Open Compute Data Center`_
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Submitted by Lance Albertson on April 19, 2011 If you've been
following the news, you've likely heard of the `Open Compute
Project`_, Facebook's project to build the most efficient data center
at the lowest possible cost and to share their knowledge with other
companies. Last Friday, Facebook opened the doors of their
`Prinveille, Oregon data center`_, inviting a host of dignitaries and
members of the press to tour this newly opened facility and learn more
about the Open Compute Project. The Open Source Lab crew was fortunate
enough to be invited to join this august group for a tour thanks to
`David Recordon`_, Facebook's Senior Open Programs Manager.


Little Known Fact: The Prineville data center is actually powered by
gnomes.
+++++++
We kicked off the day with opening ceremonies, including introductions
by several of Facebook's senior staff, members of the Oregon
Legislature and the Mayor of Prineville, Betty Ropple. Finishing off
the morning's event, Mayor Ropple and Facebook's staff pushed a
gigantic "Like" button on the opening of the data center.


There's so much "Like" going on in this photo that you can't even see
the button through the glow.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
We had a bit of down time before our actual tour began, so we chilled
out in the facility's game room and enjoyed playing Xbox together.


A little Halo, anyone?
++++++++++++++++++++++
And since we wanted to be great guests, our students also fixed one of
the displays that was offline when we arrived.


How many sys admins does it take to fix a display? At least four.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Among the many amazing things we saw on the tour, we were treated to
the first design spec ever created for the data center.


Preliminary electrical specification for the Prineville facility,
created late one night on a napkin.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  Following the tour, we were treated to an evening of dinner and music
  in an enormous party tent. It was particularly exciting to meet so
  many members of the Prineville community and hear what a positive
  impact the data center's creation has had on the local economy. Sadly,
  we missed seeing Mark Zuckerberg due to a long drive back to the
  office, but the rest of the day more than made up for it.You can read
  more about the facility on `Lance Albertson's blog`_, or check out
  Greg Lund-Chaix's `post on our visit`_. For more photos, check out
  `Leslie Hawthorn`_ and `Lance Albertson's`_ albums on Flickr. Many
  thanks once again to David and Facebook for having us! The OSL is

`OSL Newsletter: A Look Back at 2010`_
--------------------------------------
Submitted by Lance Albertson on January 3, 2011 We’ve had plenty of
good things happening at the OSL since we brought your our `last
newsletter`_, and as we’re busy gearing up for 2011 we wanted to take
a few moments to share our good news with the community.


First, the best news: We’re Hiring!
-----------------------------------
The OSL is hiring for a full-time software developer who will analyze,
design, and test software code for `Ganeti Web Manager`_, the `Protein
Geometry Database`_ and several other `homegrown Open Source Lab
projects`_. For more details on the position and instructions on how
to apply, check out the `Analyst Programmer`_ role on the Oregon State
University Jobs page.


Wrapping our Sixth GOSCON
-------------------------
Producing the `Government Open Source Conference`_ has been a six year
labor of love for the OSL team and, in particular, `Deborah Bryant`_,
our Public Sector Communities Manager. We were excited that GOSCON
returned to Oregon for its sixth instance, and even more excited when
the City of Portland declared the week of the conference "`Open Source
in Government Week`_." Attendees were treated to `more than twenty
talks`_ on all aspects of the use of open source in government, from
agency use cases to panels on how to meet the challenges of open
government initiatives. You can find a full `post-conference write
up`_ on the GOSCON website and stay tuned to all things GOSCON by
following `@goscon on Twitter`_.We've posted many of the `slide sets`_
from the conference presentations, and will be adding more as we
continue to receive them from speakers. Stay tuned for an announcement
that videos from the sessions are available, though you can already
enjoy some `video interviews`_ with speakers and attendees from
`OpenAffairs`_. You can also check out talks from the world's first
`IgniteGov on YouTube`_, and you might be interested in `Alex Howard's
O'Reilly Radar write up`_ on the talk "Why middleware is the key to a
successful gov 2.0" from Portland's very own `CivicApps contest
winner`_ and `Code for America Fellow`_, Max Ogden.


Developer News
--------------
Our developer team has been hard at work adding new features to
`Ganeti Web Manager`_, putting out the `0.4 release on December
22nd`_. New features include improvements to the caching system, SSH
key feeds, import tools and more. You can learn more about Ganeti Web
Manager's permissions system on the `blog`_ of our Lead Developer,
Peter Krenesky. For details on how the OSL uses Google's `Ganeti`_ to
manage our clusters, check out the `writings`_ from our Lead Systems
Administrator/Architect, Lance Albertson.We've also created a Twitter
stream for Ganeti Web Manager news, `@ganetiwebmgr`_. Follow us for
more news and announcements about upcoming GWM talks.In addition to
working on Ganeti Web Manager, Peter and our team of student
developers have been hard at work on a new tool for researchers, the
`Protein Geometry Database`_. The PGD gives researchers robust and
straightforward ability to analyze 16,000 non-redundant protein
chains, their backbone conformation and geometry, as well as the
relationships between them. You can learn more about the academic uses
and the development process for the PGD in one of our `recent news
articles`_, or check out the technical documentation and source code
at `http://code.osuosl.org/projects/pgd`_.


Google's Open Source Programs for Students
------------------------------------------
The OSL has been a proud participant in Google's open source programs
for students since 2006, our first year participating in `Google
Summer of Code`_. This year we had `two students successfully complete
their projects`_, both of them working on `Pydra`_, a distributed and
parallel computing framework for Python. Once again, one our student
employees mentored for the OSL this year, with Corbin Simpson working
with Bartosz Wroblewski on `Implementing Map Reduce in Pydra`_. Brian
Martin worked with Peter on a `whole wishlist of features for Pydra's
1.0 release`_. Congratulations to Bartosz and Brian, and many thanks
to them for working with us for Google Summer of Code 2010.In addition
to our participation in GSoC, we were `one of twenty mentoring
organizations`_ selected to participate in Google's second contest to
get pre-university students involved in open source, `Google Code-
in`_. We're less than seven days away from the contest closing, and
we've been incredibly pleased with our results: more than 30 tasks
have been completed to improve Ganeti Web Manager, ranging from bug
fixes, creating new features to improvements to the user interface.
We've `published an interview`_ with one of our most prolific GCI
students, Piotr, for your further reading pleasure. You might also
want to read the `post`_ from our Project Manager, Greg Lund-Chaix, on
the valuable experience provided to students participating in the
contest.Many thanks to Google and their `Open Source Team`_ for
sponsoring these great programs!

      and make the teaching of open source a global success


The OSL and Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software
------------------------------------------------------
We also welcomed two new humanitarian focused communities to the OSL
family, `CrisisCommons`_ and the `Sahana Foundation`_. CrisisCommons
is a group of individuals collaborating on a commons-based approach to
disaster relief and crisis management, most notably through their
`CrisisCamp events`_. CrisisCommons announced the move of their
infrastructure to the OSL as part of their `receipt of a $1.2M grant
from the Sloan Foundation`_.The Sahana project was initiated by
volunteers in the Sri Lankan FOSS development community to help their
fellow countrymen and countrywomen affected during the 2004 Asian
Tsunami in December 2004. Since its inception, Sahana has been
rewritten as a set of modular disaster management tools, including a
Missing Person Registry, an Inventory Management application and a
Volunteer Coordination system. You can read more about Sahana and two
other OSL hosted Humanitarian FOSS communities, `OpenMRS`_ and
`TriSano`_, in the December issue of the Open Source Business Resource
magazine on `Humanitarian Open Source`_. `Leslie Hawthorn`_, our Open
Source Outreach Manager, guest edited the issue.


Sharing Stories
---------------
We're excited to share all this great news with the community, but we
want to hear from you. What stories from the OSL would you like to
hear? What's going on in our hosted communities that we ought to be
communicating to the wider OSL community? Send your thoughts to us on

`CrisisCommons is pleased to announce partnership with OSU's Open
Source Lab`_
------------
  Submitted by OSUOSL Admin on December 15, 2010 `CrisisCommons`_ is a
  global network of volunteers who use creative problem solving and open
  technologies to help people and communities in times and places of
  crisis. CrisisCommons is pleased to join several other humanitarian
  free and open source software projects hosted by `Oregon State
  University's Open Source Lab`_ (OSL).The CrisisCommons community
  creates “`CrisisCamp`_” events where volunteers of all skill levels
  can work across borders, languages and timezones to collaborate on
  projects, translate languages, build open source technology tools, and
  aggregate data to provide support for crisis response efforts. During
  the worldwide response to the Haiti and Chile earthquakes, this
  community organized 63 events across 8 countries with over 2,300
  people participating to support such projects as `Person Finder`_, a
  searchable database of missing persons, and `Tradui`_, the first
  Creole translation application. The OSL has been part of the
  CrisisCommons community from the beginning, through the CrisisCamp
  Portland (`CrisisCampPDX`_) event on January 23, 2010.Born from the
  adversity of the Haiti event, a grass roots CrisisCommons community
  emerged and grew throughout 2010. We supported technology work on
  crisis events throughout the year, including the Tennessee Floods,
  Gulf Oil Spill, and Pakistan Floods. We hosted the First International
  Crisis Congress in July, 2010, in Washington DC, which convened
  CrisisCamp city leads, experts in disaster management, and partners in
  the public and private sector together to outline our goals and agenda
  for the commons community. Our OSL partnership continued here too, as
  `Deb Bryant`_, Public Sector Communities Manager for the OSL, was part
  of our Congress, and has been a key advisor to CrisisCommons ever
  since.One key goal global of CrisisCommons is to develop a commons-
  based approach to crisis management and global development that spans
  public and private sectors, NGO/NPO's, and other Volunteer Technology
  Communities (VTCs). We seek to do this by leveraging, supporting, or
  building through an openness mele of open source, open data, and open
  standards, and by exploring a research-based agenda to technology
  applicability in a crisis.Since the Congress, the community has been
  actively working on a foundation grant to continue its growth, and
  move beyond a grass-roots community. We are pleased to announce that
  the `Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars`_ has awarded a
  two-year, $1.2 million grant from the `Alfred P. Sloan Foundation`_ to
  support the development of CrisisCommons. CrisisCommons will be funded
  for 2 years under the Wilson center to continue our work.A key step in
  this process is establishing a solid infrastructure to support our
  CrisisCommons community activities, hence why we are excited to expand
  our partnership formally with the OSL. We are delighted to be able to
  learn from experts in open source communities and provide scalable and
  reliable resources for CrisisCamp technology innovation and response
  efforts.Our work with the OSL will focus on the following areas:

    + Hosting and support of core CrisisCommons services, including our
      websites, wikis, and other community and knowledge/training resources
      for commons/community steady-state operations
    + Establishing foundational model for Crisis/Disaster based lab and
      research based open source projects to support technology innovation
      in this space
    + Establishing a model for specific crisis/disaster response
      technology hosting that are needed in a disaster event (surge capacity
      model)
  We are still new to this, and have so much to learn from the OSL and
  their wider partner community, but are excited to start our journey.
  We look forward to joining OSL and becoming a successful `HFOSS
  project`_ under their stewardship. One more forward step together
  toward lessoning human suffering in the world, and achieving
  opportunity for good through adversity.Looking forward to the future,
  Deborah Shaddon CrisisCommons Infrastructure Working Group Lead

OSCON
-----
We were very excited to have OSCON back in Portland this year! Not
only did this mean we got to share our wonderful city with many of our
open source friends (Three OSLers live around Portland!), but Portland
is also close enough to campus that we could bring up a number of OSL
student employees and OSU CS students. It was great seeing our
students meet people in the expo hall and share some of their
experiences.The OSL was represented in a few different sessions at
OSCON. Lance Albertson joined Justin Erenkrantz (Apache Software
Foundation) and John Hawley (Linux Foundation / kernel.org) for a talk
on scaling open source project infrastructure on a shoestring budget.
Deb Bryant opened up the Health IT Track and led a panel on open
source voting solutions as well. Deb didn't stop at simply
participating in sessions. She also received one of five `O'Reilly
Open Source Awards`_ in recognition of her work in getting open source
software into state and local government agencies. Please join us in
congratulating Deb on this exciting award! We ended the week at OSCON
with a small bus tour which took a group down to Corvallis to see our
data center, and then stopped on the way back at Willamette Valley
Vineyards for lunch and wine tasting. The wine was great, and the
company on the bus was even better. We even did a network boot of
Linux over the bus's Wi-Fi using boot.kernel.org. We've got pictures
up `on Flickr`_! Our thanks go out to Aruba Networks for sponsoring
the tour.


New projects
------------
We've brought in a number of new projects during 2010, including
`CONNECT`_, `OpenEFS`_, `Meego`_ and `OSGeo`_, just to name a few. For
further information on projects hosted at OSUOSL, please see `our
Communities page`_.


Donations update
----------------
Give 6 program ends successfully -- We raised over $350,000 during the
6 for 6 program. Thank you all for your support! For more information
on the Give 6 program and our future funding plans, please see `our
recent news story`_.


Virtualization Migration Complete
---------------------------------
We have migrated all of our hosted virtual machines onto new hardware
and management software. We are now using `ganeti`_ for VM management
on top of KVM virtualization. We are currently running 65 virtual
machines on four physical servers using DRBD to replicate disks
between them for failover. The hardware is much faster than the
previous virtualization hardware we had in place, and many hosted
projects have noted a nice performance increase after the migration.


GOSCON 2010
-----------
  This year, GOSCON returns to Portland, Oregon on October 27 & 28. The
  conference venue is the Nines Hotel, located at Pioneer Square in
  downtown Portland. Early registration and the call for speakers are
  now open, and program tracks have been announced! More info on GOSCON,
  including a sign-up for the conference newsletter, can be found at

`Give 6 Program Ends Successfully`_
-----------------------------------
  Submitted by OSUOSL Admin on August 2, 2010 The Give 6 fund raising
  program which was launched last year has completed with great success.
  Friends of the Oregon State University Open Source Lab were invited to
  make a gift in honor of our sixth anniversary. Responses came from 88
  unique donors representing 27 U.S. states and 17 different countries.
  Many donors added words of appreciation: "The support we've received,
  in hardware, bandwidth, and from the volunteers and employees of the
  Open Source Lab, have been outstanding." "By supporting efforts like
  the Open Source Lab, the university is helping teach, innovate, and
  support our future."We are happy to see such a great outpouring of
  support from our hosted projects, as well as individual and corporate
  donors. Thanks to all your support, we surpassed $350,000 in donations
  during the seven month duration of the program (December 2009 through
  June 2010). We exceeded $650,000 in cash donations for the entire
  fiscal year (July 2009 through June 2010) – this does not include the
  many in-kind donations that we received such as bandwidth and
  hardware.A huge thanks from all of us at the Open Source Lab goes out
  to those who supported us last year! We continue to rely upon
  donations to support our activities at the Lab, however we are working
  to establish other means of income so that we are able to continue
  providing services to the open source community without being
  completely reliant upon external donations. For example, we are
  experimenting with grants, paid development on open source projects,

`OSUOSL Speakers at Open Source Bridge`_
----------------------------------------
  Submitted by OSUOSL Admin on May 10, 2010 We're always excited to see
  open source events happening, especially when they are in our home
  state of Oregon! `Open Source Bridge`_ will have its second annual
  conference June 1-4, and the Oregon State University Open Source Lab
  will be well represented at the event where five of our staff (plus
  one OSUOSL alumnus) will be speaking. We've got a lot of cool stuff
  going on at the OSUOSL and are excited to have a chance to share some
  of the things we've been up to.Want to hear about how we are handling
  virtualization at the OSUOSL? Lance Albertson will be giving a talk
  titled `"Creating a low-cost clustered virtualization environment
  using Ganeti"`_ which describes our recent migration to a redundant
  and easily scalable virtualization setup using the open source
  project, `Ganeti`_. Come and hear about the ups-and-downs and other
  juicy details of our migration from the old Xen-based setup with
  central disk storage to the new Ganeti setup which uses local storage
  on servers combined with DRBD for redundancy.Maybe virtualization
  isn't your thing, but you'd be more interested to hear about
  interactive "touchscreen" displays such as the one we use in our data
  center to show network graphs, FTP downloads, and other general
  information. Peter Krenesky and Rob McGuire-Dale will talk about our
  `Touchscreen application`_ during their talk, `"Building Interactive
  Displays with Touchscreen 2.0"`_. This talk will show off some of the
  cool features of Touchscreen 2.0 which has been built using Django and
  jQuery.At the OSUOSL we host a lot of high-traffic websites. From an
  open source project's point of view, the more traffic to your site the
  better! However, from a system administration point of view, more
  traffic tends to mean more headaches as you try to keep sites fast and
  responsive during a flood of traffic. This can be especially
  challenging when dealing with dynamic web applications such as Drupal.
  Rudy Grigar and Greg Lund-Chaix have a talk titled `"Making Drupal Go
  Fast with Varnish and Pressflow"`_ which describes how the combination
  of Varnish and Pressflow can be used to cache much more content than a
  standard Drupal install -- leading to faster websites and happier
  servers. They will get into details about Varnish and Pressflow and
  give some real-world examples of similar setups at the OSUOSL.We're
  also very happy to see Alex Polvi, a former student employee at
  OSUOSL, come to give his talk: `"libcloud: a unified interface into
  the cloud"`_. Alex is the CEO at `Cloudkick`_ where they use
  `libcloud`_ to build their cloud management and monitoring services.
  libcloud is an Apache Incubator project which provides a unified
  interface into many cloud providers such as Amazon EC2, Slicehost, and
  Rackspace.Hopefully you're as excited as we are to head to Open Source
  Bridge and check out these and many other great talks. See you there!

`MeeGo Comes to OSUOSL`_
------------------------
  Submitted by OSUOSL Admin on April 13, 2010 As part a major effort and
  plan by the worldwide Nokia (Mameo project) and Intel (Moblin project)
  to share the `MeeGo`_ operating system code with the open source
  community, MeeGo has selected OSU's Open Source Lab as its
  infrastructure home. Today MeeGo is an open source project hosted by
  the Linux Foundation that encourages community contributions in
  accordance with the best practices of the open source development
  model.MeeGo is an open source, Linux project which brings together the
  Moblin project, headed up by Intel, and Maemo, by Nokia, into a single
  open source activity. MeeGo integrates the experience and skills of
  two significant development ecosystems, versed in communications and
  computing technologies. According to the project's web site, they
  believe "these two pillars form the technical foundations for next
  generation platforms and usages in the mobile and device platforms
  space."The MeeGo distribution infrastructure and the operating system
  base from the Linux kernel to the OS infrastructure up to the
  middleware layer. The MeeGo architecture is based on a common core
  across the different usage models, such as netbooks, handheld, in-
  vehicle, and connected TV. The MeeGo common core includes the various
  key subsystems including the core operating system libraries, the
  comms and telephony services, internet and social networking services,
  visual services, media services, data management, device services, and
  personal services. You can read more about MeeGo at
  `http://meego.com/about`_OSUOSL will provide hosting, infrastructure,
  and distribution support for the production environment for the
  project as well as the build server infrastructure. Now that MeeGo
  calls the OSL home, the Lab hopes to get undergrad students involved
  in software development for the project. Other hardware-oriented
  projects OSL students have taken part in include the One Laptop Per
  Child - OLPC - project.Photos of MeeGo moving day were captured by
  Senior System Administrator Lance Albertson and can be viewed on `our

`Drupal Association supports OSUOSL with $15,000`_
--------------------------------------------------
  Submitted by OSUOSL Admin on December 28, 2009 The Drupal Association
  is supporting the Oregon State University Open Source Lab to the tune
  of $15,000. Specifically, $10,000 is being directed specifically
  towards paying OSL student employees to work on drupal.org
  infrastructure tasks. Our students have been instrumental in setting
  up and maintaining the infrastructure for drupal.org and related
  sites, and we are very excited to be able to dedicate more time to
  this important project.Additionally, the Drupal Association has
  committed to make a $5,000 donation to the Open Source Lab general
  fund. This money is used to support all of our activities at the OSL,
  for specifics, please see our `FAQ`_. It is great to see a project
  hosted at the OSL become large enough that they are able to support
  the Lab with a monetary donation, especially as we celebrate our sixth
  anniversary with the `Give 6`_ program.For more information about
  Drupal, see `http://drupal.org`_ Or visit the Drupal Association

`TeachEngineering`_
-------------------
  Submitted by Lance Albertson on December 10, 2009 `TeachEngineering`_
  is a digital library of over 800 K-12 engineering lessons and hands-on
  activities. The lesson materials in TeachEngineering are developed by
  a variety of organizations and programs and are made available free-
  of-charge to educators. The Oregon State University Open Source Lab is
  proud to provide hosting and system administration for the
  TeachEngineering website and development servers. TeachEngineering has
  become another great example of the use of open source at
  OSU.Development of the collection was motivated by the following:

    + To consolidate and make searchable a large amount of excellent
      curriculum that was previously dispersed over various organizations,
      and which was stored in different formats and different document
      structures.
    + All learning materials in TeachEngineering use engineering as the
      vehicle to study math and science. As such, TeachEngineering is meant
      to promote the use of engineering as a means for learning in K-12
      environments.
    + TeachEngineering lessons and exercises are structured to fit
      teaching K-12 students and to provide K-12 science and math teachers
      with suitable and hands-on curriculum at no cost except their effort
      having to master and improve it. With this approach the collection
      developers hope to support teachers and students in poorer schools and
      districts.
    + All teaching materials in TeachEngineering are 'aligned' with the
      mathematics, science and technology K-12 educational standards of all
      U.S. states as well as with the standards formulated by a variety of
      nongovernmental national standard bodies. This should make it easier
      for teachers to find curriculum that fits the standards to which they
      must teach.
  Besides its HTML interface targeted at people, TeachEngineering both
  exposes and uses a variety of Web services. Among these are services
  to expose its collection's metadata to other collections―try, for
  example, a search for the term 'spaghetti' in the `National Science
  Digital Library`_ ―and services from third-party providers that help
  with the automatic alignment of curriculum and standards.The
  collection and its software infrastructure are housed at Oregon State
  University's Open Source Lab and are almost entirely developed and
  implemented using open source software tools. Visit

`OSCON 2009`_
-------------
  Submitted by OSUOSL Admin on July 17, 2009 Being located so close to
  Portland, of course we at the OSU Open Source Lab were sad to see
  OSCON move down to the Bay Area this year. However, it remains a great
  convention not only for the abundance of wonderful sessions, but for
  bringing together so many open source contributors from all around the
  world. So, even though it means a bit of traveling for us this year,
  we'll be at OSCON next week -- not with are usual booth in the expo
  hall, but we will be participating in a number of sessions.On
  Wednesday at 2:35, Lance Albertson will be giving a talk entitled
  `Server Management and Source Control: The key to scalability and
  teamwork`_. Lance leads our systems team which hosts some of the most
  well-known open source projects and communities in the world. Lance's
  talk will give you a chance to see how we handle automation for our
  servers using cfengine and git to allow for all systems team members
  to easily collaborate and push changes to servers.At 4:30 on
  Wednesday, Deborah Bryant will lead a panel entitled `Bureaucrats,
  Technocrats and Policy Cats: How the Government is turning to Open
  Source, and Why`_. Other participants include Bjorn Freeman-Benson
  (DemocracyLab), Greg Lund-Chaix (OSUOSL), Clay Johnson (Sunlight
  Labs), and Aleksandar Totic (Open Source Digital Voting Foundation).
  This will be a great discussion on government moving to open source
  and transparency.Thursday afternoon at 1:45 will be the much-
  anticipated `State of Lightning Talks 2009`_ lead by Josh Berkus.
  Always informative and entertaining, the State of Lightning Talks give
  a handful of projects five minutes a piece to update everyone on
  what's currently going on in their project & communities. Jeff
  Sheltren will be there to give everyone the run-down on what's new at
  the Open Source Lab this year.We look forward to seeing you there!

`Hardware Donation Expands OSUOSL Infrastructure`_
--------------------------------------------------
  Submitted by OSUOSL Admin on May 22, 2009 The Oregon State University
  Open Source Lab recently received a large gift in-kind donation from a
  local Portland company which included approximately 20 servers, two
  NetApp filers with approximately 14TB of disk space, load balancers,
  and more. This is a very generous donation which will help the OSL
  replace aging hardware and expand our current infrastructure to
  support even more services and open source projects.One of the donated
  servers (pictured here), an HP dl580 with 20GB of RAM and dual dual-
  core Xeon processors has already been put to use as a community
  database server. The OSL is currently running five such servers which

`Reciprocity and Gentoo`_
-------------------------
  Submitted by Lance Albertson on February 5, 2009 It's not an
  overstatement to say that Gentoo was integral to the Open Source Lab’s
  foundation. The Linux-based operating system was one of the OSL's
  first projects – it even preceded the existence of the lab – and was
  instrumental in building the buzz that put open source at OSU on the
  map.It started when Gentoo reached out to the open source community
  for help – it needed more infrastructure, and OSU provided it. "Web
  services donated an old Dell server, and from there Gentoo just grew
  and grew," says Lance Albertson, lead Unix systems administrator at
  the OSL.Gentoo, which was already popular with the open source
  community at OSU, is an ideal system for many developers because it
  allows them to install their own meta-distribution. Everyone who uses
  Gentoo can compile his or her own code, making it extremely flexible
  and customizable. "The community thought, 'if OSU is using Gentoo, it
  must be good,'" says Albertson. Word-of-mouth brought OSU enough
  attention to be covered in Slashdot.org, the site that bills itself as
  "News for Nerds." As more people learned about OSU's hosting
  capabilities, more people reached out to its open source community –
  and the Lab's reputation was born."The OSL is unique," says Donnie
  Berkholz, an OSU graduate student in biochemistry and biophysics, and
  a member of Gentoo's leadership. "They help out these nonprofit
  projects when there's no one else who would provide these services
  without charging a lot of money we don’t have."Without the OSL's
  hosting capabilities, projects like Gentoo would have to scale back to
  the point that service to developers would disappear, or degrade to
  the point where it’s too hard for developers to work with."Most
  universities will host a couple of boxes for you, but trying to
  coordinate among them is difficult," says Albertson. "At the OSL
  hosting these machines is a top priority." Category: `Hosting

`Helping Drupal Grow`_
----------------------
  Submitted by OSUOSL Admin on February 5, 2009 When Drupal began to
  outgrow its infrastructure in the summer of 2005, its developers
  appealed to the open source community for help. OSL offered to host
  the equipment, and students Eric Searcy and Narayan Newton were put on
  the case."We attacked the problem from two different angles," says
  Newton, who now works with Tag1 Consulting and is a member of the
  association that runs Drupal. Searcy, now a systems administrator at
  InsightsNow in Corvallis, dealt with the scaling of the Web side of
  Drupal while Newton worked with the database.They planned several
  tiers of attack, starting with two load balancers that became proxies
  that sent requests to Drupal's servers. It was easy then to know which
  server was up or down and to add new nodes quickly. The load balancers
  cached Drupal's Web pages, which would deliver older pages without
  needlessly taxing the Web server.Newton and Searcy also added more
  memory and a second powerful database server. "At that point things
  started to stabilize," says Searcy. "Drupal had a huge growth spurt
  during that period. Several times we solved things for a week. And
  then the demand would rise even higher to exceed the performance gains
  we'd made."In order to balance the needs of the database and front
  end, Newton and Searcy would help each other troubleshoot. "We'd have
  to communicate to find out where the bottlenecks were," says Newton.
  "Sometimes, if the Web server was the bottleneck, the database server
  wasn't seeing lots of activity and would be fine. The minute the
  bottleneck was removed, you'd throw a lot onto the other person."Both
  Searcy and Newton credit the Open Source Lab with providing them with
  real-world experience. "The opportunities on the systems
  administration side of the Lab for university students are unique,"
  says Newton. "I can't name any other school that offers the same
  thing." Category: `Student Stories`_

  environmental hazards, and bioterrorism attacks. TriSano is soon to be
  deployed in hospitals throughout Utah. TriSano works like a front end
  for a database of information, Schonstal says. So when a health
  professional has a report to make, he or she gets a form that is
  separated into different concerns. The information is later accessible
  and editable to anyone with clearance to use the system. OSU senior
  Josh Schonstal was in second grade when he wrote his first computer
  program with his father’s help. As an eighth grader he was working
  with his friends on a basic role-playing game. OSU was the only school
  he applied to when he was looking for colleges, and that was because
  of the Open Source Lab. "I knew they hosted my favorite distribution
  of Linux," he says. "But I didn’t understand the caliber of experience
  I’d be getting. It’s really helped me grow as a developer."During his
  time at OSL, Schonstal has worked on One Laptop Per Child, and
  recently has been spending his time on TriSano, a tool that helps the
  Centers for Disease Control monitor outbreaks of infectious disease,
  environmental hazards, and bioterrorism attacks. TriSano was recently
  deployed in hospitals throughout Utah. TriSano works like a front end
  for a database of information, Schonstal says. So when a health
  professional has a report to make, he or she gets a form that is
  separated into different concerns. The information is later accessible
  and editable to anyone with clearance to use the system. "Ideally we
  want as many hospitals as possible to use this software," Schonstal
  says. "It will help with the Centers for Disease Control’s ability to
  control outbreaks."Mostly, Schonstal works on bugs and noncritical
  parts of the application alongside developers from Collaborative
  Software Initiative. "They’re really into development," Schonstal
  says. "They don’t sit around and wait until five o’clock rolls around.
  It’s really cool to get to work with those people."Schonstal isn’t
  sure what he will do after he graduates in the spring, but he thinks
  the opportunities OSL has provided have prepared him well. "The open
  source community is really merit-based, so people who contribute more
  are going to be well-regarded in the community," he says. Category:

`OSUOSL Hosts OpenMRS Development`_
-----------------------------------
  Submitted by OSUOSL Admin on January 12, 2009 OpenMRS is an open
  source electronic medical record system framework. Led by the
  `Regenstrief Institute`_ and `Partners In Health`_, OpenMRS has been
  implemented in several countries including South Africa, Kenya,
  Rwanda, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Uganda, and Tanzania.The Oregon
  State University Open Source Lab is providing hosting for the OpenMRS
  Development Website including a Trac instance at
  `http://dev.openmrs.org`_ and the OpenMRS subversion repository. We
  are happy to provide services to OpenMRS and support their efforts in
  bringing usable medical information systems to developing countries
  where HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis are a major problem."We've
  been growing the OpenMRS community for over four years now, largely
  building up our online community presence in our spare time.
  Fortunately, we grew beyond the point where this hosting approach made
  sense for us. In our conversations with the top open source projects,
  Oregon State University's Open Source Lab was repeatedly introduced as
  a perfect transition strategy for an organization like ours. I've
  found them to be the perfect balance of fun and easy to work with as
  well as professional when it counts. We are confident in their ability
  to manage our mission critical code repository and online web
  presence. I couldn't recommend them highly enough!" -- Paul Biondich,
  co-founder, OpenMRS

`OSUOSL One of Nation's "Really Cool" Networking Labs`_
-------------------------------------------------------
  Submitted by OSUOSL Admin on January 10, 2009 The Oregon State
  University Open Source Lab was recently featured in a Network World
  online story about really cool university computer network labs. This
  is a great honor for us, and we are glad to be in such good company.
  Some of the highlights of the OSUOSL included in the list were our
  hosting of projects such as the `Linux Kernel`_, `Drupal`_, the `Linux
  Foundation`_, our development work on the `Oregon Virtual School
  District`_, and our annual `Government Open Source Conference`_.The
  Network World article is located at

`New Open Source Government Communities Come Together at GOSCON`_
-----------------------------------------------------------------
  Submitted by OSUOSL Admin on October 8, 2008 On October 22, 2008,
  government and private industry experts will debate the issues and
  opportunities presented by collaborative software development models
  at the `Government Open Source Conference (GOSCON)`_ in Portland, Ore.
  The distinguished panelists have direct experience with successful
  public/private consortiums based on the open source software model in
  which developers as well as business and technical users collaborate
  to create new applications while sharing both the costs and the
  benefits."The advantages to moving to an open source model for
  government software would not just be lower costs and better knowledge
  sharing across the public sector; it might also take us closer to the
  level of access, transparency and flexibility that the public is
  starting to demand from its governments, said Brian Belhendorf,
  CollabNet founder and Mozilla board director. "Software development is
  at its core a collaborative process -- collaborative between
  developers, even those working on different projects, and
  collaborative between developers and users. The ‘big deal' about the
  Open Source model is that it recognizes this fact and makes it
  possible to move away from treating every project as an isolated
  endeavor. I look forward to being a part of this conversation."The
  "Open Government Collaboratives" panel will be led by Oregon
  Department of Transportation Chief Information Officer Benjamin Berry
  and Newport News, Virginia IT Director Andy Stein. The duo brings
  years of experience in early adoption of open source software and
  models in government environments. Their goal is to draw the audience
  -- primarily state, local and national goverment IT management -- into
  the session and extract a reference model for additional communities
  on the spot.GOSCON is organized by the OSL. The conference is part of
  its mission to education and support community.

`rpm.org and yum move to OSUOSL`_
---------------------------------
  Submitted by OSUOSL Admin on September 29, 2008 The Oregon State
  University Open Source Lab is proud to be the new home for two very
  important OSS projects. We are now hosting the main web sites, ticket
  trackers, code repositories, and mailing lists for RPM and yum.`RPM`_
  is the package management system used by many Linux distributions
  including RedHat Enterprise, Fedora, SUSE, CentOS, Mandriva, and many
  others. The RPM format is also part of the `Linux Standards
  Base`_.`Yum`_ is a package installer/remover for RPM-based systems,
  and does all the work to calculate dependencies for packages that you
  want to install or remove. Yum is the default package manager for
  RedHat Enterprise, Fedora and CentOS Linux distributions. In addition
  to yum, the OSUOSL is also hosting development sites for yum-utils, a
  collection of utilities and scripts built around yum, and createrepo,
  the program which creates metadata used in package repositories
  (supported by yum, apt-rpm, red-carpet, smart, up2date, and yast).The
  sites for RPM and yum can be found at `http://rpm.org`_ and
  `http://yum.baseurl.org`_, respectively.

`A look back at the OSL's partnerships with Google and TDS`_
------------------------------------------------------------
  Submitted by Anonymous on March 6, 2006 *As the Open Source Lab
  celebrates a decade of open source hosting, development and education,
  the lab is reflecting on its past accomplishments. Below is a favorite
  from our archives.* OSL Teams with TDS for Bandwidth Increase
  *Originally published on March 06, 2006*The Open Source Lab at Oregon
  State University has received a large donation of Internet bandwidth
  from TDS Telecom that will allow it to more than double the number of
  visitors it can serve, in the future helping up to 50 million people a
  day review or download free software.For a five-year period, the Open
  Source Lab will receive 600 megabits of bandwidth - a volume of
  Internet connectivity that is more than five times higher than the
  total used by the rest of the university. In addition, OSU servers
  will be hosted in a TDS Data Center.“This gift from TDS Telecom really
  allows OSU to continue its integrated efforts in education, research,
  and outreach in the Open Source space. The increased bandwidth gives
  OSU strong reach into many of the communities it serves,” said Ed Ray,
  President of Oregon State University.TDS Telecom is a major telephone
  and Internet services provider. Their donation of bandwidth to OSU
  will help TDS balance the volume of data they share back and forth
  with other networks, which is necessary for the smooth operation of
  the global Internet system.OSU's Open Source Lab is a national leader
  in the exchange of open source software. OSU, for instance, is one of
  the main distributor's of Mozilla Firefox, a popular Web browser that
  is widely used around the world. Often without realizing it, people
  who download Mozilla Firefox to their computers are going through an
  OSU laboratory. The TDS donation will enable OSU to provide more
  highly demanded content. "TDS Telecom believes in the work we're doing
  with the open source software community, and they know this bandwidth
  will be put to a very good use,” said Scott Kveton, director of the
  Open Source Laboratory at OSU. "This will allow us to significantly
  expand our impact, visibility, and services.”Unlike proprietary
  systems that are purchased from individual companies, open source
  software is generally free to anyone. Its code or blueprints are
  available to work with, improve, customize for individual needs, and
  pass along to the next user. This collaborative process often results
  in software of very high quality, and the concept is rapidly gaining
  interest in the consumer and business communities.The new TDS
  donation, Kveton said, should allow the Open Source Lab to expand the
  software services it can host and provide freely to others. The
  laboratory is already actively working with the Pacific Northwest and
  national business community, helping to educate business leaders about
  the wide range of software available through open source - everything
  from word processing to spreadsheets, Web browsing and other needs.
  And one of the facility's best customers is the university itself,
  which has saved significant amounts of money by using open source
  software for more than half of its operations.

`A look back at Mozilla Firefox 1.0`_
-------------------------------------
  Submitted by Anonymous on November 16, 2004 *As the Open Source Lab
  celebrates a decade of open source hosting, development and education,
  the lab is reflecting on its past accomplishments. Below is a favorite
  from our archives.* OSL Hosting Popular New Firefox Web Browser
  *Originally posted on November 16, 2004*Mozilla’s Firefox 1.0, the
  newly released Web browser available at `www.mozilla.org`_, is living
  quietly in the Oregon State University Open Source Lab. The Open
  Source Lab is a world-class facility and data center for Open Source
  Software (OSS) knowledge, hosting, infrastructure, development and
  collaboration.Creating an atmosphere of innovation and creativity for
  students, faculty and staff is a critical piece of the OSL's mission.
  “Collaborations there provide new and innovative solutions that would
  not have been possible without its growing success,” said Curt
  Pederson, vice provost for Information Services. “The Open Source Lab
  continues to save the University money at a time of decreasing state
  resources.” OSU hosts the software update services, website and
  download redirector for Mozilla.“The open source lab played a big part
  in our Firefox 1.0 launch with over one million downloads on its first
  day of availability,” said Chris Hofmann, Mozilla Foundation’s
  Director of Engineering. Firefox 1.0, available for the Windows, Linux
  and Mac operating systems in more than a dozen languages, is the
  result of two years of work by literally hundreds of programmers. The
  browser is an absolute joy to use - smart, fast and very user-
  friendly, while still offering a multitude of advanced programmable
  and customizable functions for those who want to tinker.“We began
  collaborating with Mozilla because we have been mirroring several
  other open source projects for many years,” said Scott Kveton,
  Associate Director at OSL. “We have helped them grow to over 40
  mirrors across the globe and have developed tools with them to spread
  the load across all of those mirrors in a reliable fashion. In the
  past week there have been about 4 million downloads of Firefox 1.0”The
  Mozilla Foundation, a California-based non-profit organization, is
  dedicated to developing open source software that provides users with
  choice and improved web experiences. Mozilla has already made
  considerable inroads into the browser market. Firefox features a pop-
  up ad blocker, online fraud protection and the ability to display
  several web pages in a single window, using "tabbed browsing."“OSU's
  Open Source Lab has already helped the University save thousands of
  dollars by coming up with new solutions to otherwise expensive
  problems,” said OSU Provost and Executive Vice President, Sabah
  Randawah. Scott Kveton couldn’t agree more. “Mozilla is covering the
  cost of bandwidth and equipment hosted here at OSU and we are offering
  up our expertise as well as student help to provide these services,”
  he said. “OSU’s hosting efforts have resulted in several donations
  from open source users in the community. We are always looking for
  more donations to help provide support for some of the bigger open
  source projects that need world-class facilities to deliver their
  software to the masses.”Perhaps the most important thing about these
  projects is what they bring to OSU in terms of human capital. “This
  has helped make OSU the home of open source by being able to help
  projects such as Mozilla,” continued Kveton. “Having Mozilla hosted at
  OSU has opened up some fantastic learning opportunities for students
  as well as added to the synergy occurring here. On Tuesday Mozilla
  Firefox had approximately 100 million hits across 7 million unique
  visitors. The Gentoo Linux community jumped in to help build out some
  machines that were hosted at the open source lab to handle the
  increased traffic. Without this kind of collaboration we wouldn't have
  been able to pull off the 1.0 release.”OSU’s strategic plan states,
  “In today’s high technology global economy and fast-changing world, we
  will be an engine for economic growth and social progress in Oregon.”
