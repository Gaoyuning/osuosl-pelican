The Open Source Lab partners with `IBM`_ to host `POWER`_ based servers in order
to provide an open platform for innovation to the open source community. Current
projects embrace open software projects ranging from KVM to OpenStack and open
collaboration with `OpenPOWER Foundation`_ partners, including `NVIDIA`_,
`Mellanox`_, `Ubuntu`_ and `Google`_, and open source based ISV and distribution
partners, such as `Chef`_, Red Hat, SUSE and Ubuntu, who support the latest
POWER hardware via production and development (Fedora, CentOS, OpenSUSE, and
Debian) distributions.

Members of the community can use these POWER servers to develop and test open
source projects on the `Power Architecture`_ platform and in a `PowerLinux`_
environment. Developers looking for assistance can go to the `Linux on IBM Power
Systems Developer`_ portal or `IBM Portal for OpenPOWER`_.

Two clusters of POWER resources are hosted at the Open Source Lab.

The first is an OpenStack based cluster offering POWER8 (POWER9 once available)
LE instances running on KVM and providing access via OpenStack's API and GUI
interface.  These shared systems are intended for functional development and
continuous integration work, but are not ideal for performance testing.  We
start projects out with a small quota, but can increase given resource
availability and justification. To request access to an OpenStack POWER
instance, use our `OpenPOWER OpenStack request form`_.

The second is an OpenPOWER GPU based acceleration cluster offering POWER8+
"Minsky" servers with NVIDIA P100 GPUs connected via NVLink.  To request access
to the OpenPOWER GPU cluster, use our `OpenPOWER GPU request form`_.
