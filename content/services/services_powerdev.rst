:title: PowerLinux / OpenPOWER Development Hosting

The Open Source Lab partners with `IBM <http://www-03.ibm.com/linux/ltc/>`_ to host `POWER <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_POWER_microprocessors>`_ based
servers in order to provide an open platform for innovation to the
open source community. Current projects embrace open software projects
ranging from KVM to OpenStack and open collaboration with `OpenPOWER
Foundation <http://openpowerfoundation.org>`_ partners, including `Mellanox <https://www.mellanox.com>`_, `Ubuntu <http://www.ubuntu.com>`_ and `Google <https://www.google.com>`_,
and open source based ISV and distribution partners, such as `Chef <https://www.chef.io/chef/>`_,
Red Hat, SUSE and Ubuntu, who support the latest POWER hardware via
production and development (Fedora, OpenSUSE, and Debian)
distributions.

Members of the community can use these POWER servers to develop and
test open source projects on the `Power Architecture <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Architecture>`_ platform and in
a `PowerLinux <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerLinux>`_ environment. These shared systems are intended for
functional development and testing work, but are not ideal for
performance testing.

We offer either POWER7+ big endian instances using LPARs or POWER8 big
or little endian instances running on KVM and providing access via
OpenStack's API and GUI interface. The POWER8 instances offer much
more flexibility, giving the ability to spin up or down instances on
demand. We start projects out with a small quota, but can increase
given resource availability and justification.

To request access to a POWER server, use our `request form </services/powerdev/request_hosting>`_ and we
will get back to you shortly.
