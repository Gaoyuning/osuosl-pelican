"University of Alberta and Universidade de Campinas","The goal is to investigate the use of the speculation support in POWER8 for the speeding up the sequential execution of programs. Single-threaded speculation has been used in the past, through trace-based compilation. The goal of this project is to investigate multi-threaded speculation of alternative paths of execution in a sequential execution. This is a joint project between University of Alberta -(UofA) and Universidade de Campinas (Unicamp)."
