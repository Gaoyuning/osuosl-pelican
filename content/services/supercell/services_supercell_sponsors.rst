Facebook is a social utility that helps over 500 million people around
the world communicate more efficiently with their friends, family and
coworkers. The site has been built on common open source software such
as Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP. Over the past few years, the company
has developed a number of open source infrastructure technologies to
support the site's growth including HipHop for PHP, Cassandra, Hive,
Scribe, and Thrift. Facebook engineers actively contribute and
participate in various open source projects, especially around the
Apache Hadoop ecosystem, developing technologies that facilitate the
sharing of information through the social graph.

The creation of Supercell was made possible by a generous monetary and
hardware donation from `Facebook <http://www.facebook.com/>`_ and their `Open Source Team <http://developers.facebook.com/opensource>`_.
