The Google Summer of Code program with the Oregon State University Open Source
Lab is a yearly program designed to pair accepted student applicants with
trained mentors in an effort to generate as many programming projects as our
systems can handle. It is part of a larger initiative from Google to connect
Open Source programs around the globe to create an international community
through code. The OSU Open Source Lab uses this project as a way to introduce
our own students to this international community while improving our existing
systems through collaborative and original programming strategies.

Though you must be accepted into the program, any student 18 and older may
apply. For more information on the program and applying, visit our
`GSoC website`_.

Make this summer your Summer of Code!
