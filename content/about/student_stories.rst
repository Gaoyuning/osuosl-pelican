Our Student Stories are a special collection of experiences and thoughts from
the students themselves. Check out what our student employees find exciting and
worth taking some time to tell you about.

Amanda Kelner on Graduating
---------------------------

As of September 8th, my time here at OSU will officially come to an end. As sad
as I'll be to leave my life here in Corvallis and as nervewracking it is to
enter the real world, I realized recently I've spent the last seventeen years of
my life in school and I'm ready to break free!

I'll be leaving with both a degree in English and in music performance, both of
which have taught me so much not just about their respective fields, but about
growing up and how to work with what you've got.

While I did not have the skills or the privilage to be a student developer or
systems administrator, I feel that my time here at the OSL has been incredibly
valuable. I've learned so much here that I would never have gained from a class.
The challenges I've faced and the experiences I've had taught me diligence,
patience, and flexibility. I firmly believe that my time here at the OSL has
shaped me into a person who is unafraid and excited to leave college.

I'm more than ready to start my new life, but I will miss the friends I've made
and the life I've created here at OSU. The best of luck to my peers and go
beavs!

Cody Holliday on Why we should stop using C
-------------------------------------------

Programming languages are a touchy topic in Computer Science. In certain crowds
even mentioning a language will elicit groans and eye-rolling. Conversely, there
are crowds that will only use certain languages for all projects.

These people have lost sight of the fact that programming languages are tools.
Languages have certain problem sets that they're really good at and some not so  
much. If you were to ask me to do some complex math or signal processing I would
point you to MATLAB. Would I use MATLAB for developing a GUI? Not in a million years.
So why do we choose C? Well, C is efficient since it's practically one step above
assembly and with GCC it compiles down to a small executable. This is great for 
embedded programming and systems level programming, which is why we have been
using it for so long in these feilds! However, the one problem with C is that it's
like assembly. It will let you do whatever you want, even if that means shooting 
yourself in the foot. There is no type safety, there is no memory protection, and no
thread safety built into the language. You have to do all of that yourself with
mutexes, semaphores, and checks. Some of you might think that this is fine and dandy 
and that is fair. Not everyone should think alike. However, I propose that we move to
tools that help you rather than give you enough rope to hang yourself with.
With computers being as important as they are, security should be our number one 
priority when writing software. If you're writing an application that does an  
unbounded copy from input (i.e. heartbleed) in your final release, you just added 
another vector of attack to someone's computer.

We should be writing code that is safe and avoids all sorts of memory issues that
can be solved by using the right tools. Writing C is cool because it's freeing, but 
I think we should move to bigger and better tools that save us from our own stupid
mistakes and hit us over the head with them.

As for embedded programming, there are other options out there that
maybe won't be as small as C, but will make your device more secure.
