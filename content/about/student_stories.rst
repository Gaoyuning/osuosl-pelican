Amanda Kelner on Graduating
---------------------------

As of September 8th, my time here at OSU will officially come to an end. As sad
as I'll be to leave my life here in Corvallis and as nervewracking it is to
enter the real world, I realized recently I've spent the last seventeen years of
my life in school and I'm ready to break free!

I'll be leaving with both a degree in English and in music performance, both of
which have taught me so much not just about their respective fields, but about
growing up and how to work with what you've got.

While I did not have the skills or the privilage to be a student developer or
systems administrator, I feel that my time here at the OSL has been incredibly
valuable. I've learned so much here that I would never have gained from a class.
The challenges I've faced and the experiences I've had taught me diligence,
patience, and flexibility. I firmly believe that my time here at the OSL has
shaped me into a person who is unafraid and excited to leave college.

I'm more than ready to start my new life, but I will miss the friends I've made
and the life I've created here at OSU. The best of luck to my peers and go
beavs!
