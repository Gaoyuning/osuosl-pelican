Weâ€™re very excited to announce our very first `crowdfunding campaign`_ through
the OSU foundation! The OSL relies on donations and revenue generating projects
to fund its work and its students--the number of students we can hire and train
is dependent on the donations we receive.

Help us fund five additional students for the coming year, including wages,
professional mentoring, and the opportunity to attend a major open source
conference, such as `SCALE`_ or `OSCON`_.

Become part of our rich community of engaged learners and next generation open
source leaders. Your donations will give our students the chance at life-
changing experiences and opportunities and ultimately help expand the pipeline
of graduates with DevOps and open source software experience.

Please visit our `crowdfunding page`_ for more information and to watch our
progress. If you would like to become a regular donor for the OSL, please
contact us at donations@osuosl.org.

Also, for regular updates on this project and many others, follow us on
`Facebook`_, `Twitter`_, and `Instagram`_.
