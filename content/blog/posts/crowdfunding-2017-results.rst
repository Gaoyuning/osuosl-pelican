As of September 1, the OSL has concluded its first ever crowdfunding campaign.
With the support of our donors and the larger open source community, we managed
to raise **$7,140** to support our students here at the lab in compensating them
for their work and enriching their experience through events such as `Beaver
Barcamp`_ and other conferences.

We are so very thankful for the support of our partners and friends. If you
would like to donate to the OSL, visit our `donation page`_ or our `OSU
Foundation page`_ to make a direct donation. And follow us on `Facebook`_,
`Twitter`_, and `Instagram`_ to hear about more fundraising opportunities we
hold in the future.

Thank you!
