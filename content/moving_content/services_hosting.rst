Hosting
-------




Managed and Unmanaged Hosting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our hosting support staff members understand open source software and,
matched with our carrier-grade facilities, offer the perfect hosting
environment for your project.



We are flexible and work to meet the needs of each individual client.
If you have a server to host, need to purchase a server or simply a
portion of a server, we can help. We also make available a `full
offering of services`_ to all of our hosted clients, reducing the
amount of administration you are required to do in your own
infrastructure.


To Request Hosting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Open Source Lab provides hosting for projects and communities
involved with open source software development. Typically we refer to
the Open Source Initiative's definition of open source, found at
opensource.org. If your project follows an open development model and
is freely available under an OSI-approved license, you may qualify for
hosting. For more about which projects we consider for hosting, see
our `Hosting Policy`_.

To request hosting with the Open Source Lab, `please fill out this
Hosting Request form`_

*Please give us a few days to discuss and respond.*
