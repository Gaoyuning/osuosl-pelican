Platinum Sponsors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below are groups who support the Open Source Lab through annual
contributions of *$100,000* or more.

` `_

Google is one of the world's leading search engines and is quickly
becoming a leader in the Web services industry. According to their
website, "Google's mission is to organize the world's information and
make it universally accessible and useful." The OSL shares in this
mission by organizing the resources of the open source community,
making it easier for developers to focus on writing code.

Google sponsors the OSL through financial grants. This funding helps
the OSL provide the community with physical hosting and bandwidth, and
covers the cost of "Smart Hands" support. Google is a big supporter of
the open source movement, producing open code of their own (see
`code.google.com`_), and sponsoring the Summer of Code program. Each
year Google puts millions of dollars toward open source research and
development through this program.

` `_

Schooner Information Technology has pioneered a new generation of data
access appliances specifically designed for information-intensive Web
2.0 and cloud computing data centers.

In support of the open source community, Schooner has donated its
flagship appliances for Memcached and MySQL Enterprise™ with InnoDB to
the OSU Open Source Lab. By combining the most advanced technologies
currently available, including highly parallel flash controllers,
high-throughput networking and Intel’s innovative multi-thread Nehalem
processor with a proprietary software optimization environment,
Schooner is revolutionizing storage for information-intensive
companies using Memcached and MySQL. The result is Schooner’s highly
integrated hardware and software solutions for Memcached and MySQL,
offering breakthrough performance, scalability and reliability while
substantially decreasing overall power consumption.

` `_

TDS Telecom is a major telephone and Internet services provider. TDS
Telecom has made a large donation of bandwidth to the Open Source Lab,
helping millions of people review or download free software every day.

For a five-year period, the OSL will receive 2 gigabits of bandwidth −
a volume of Internet connectivity that is more than five times higher
than the total used by the rest of the university. In addition, OSU
servers will be hosted in a TDS data center. The bandwidth provided
gives the OSL the ability to host FTP servers in both New York, N.Y.,
and Chicago, Ill., where files for many open source projects are
mirrored for download from the main FTP server hosted in Corvallis,
Ore.


Gold Sponsors

` `_

The Collaborative Software Initiative (CSI) brings together like-
minded companies to build software applications at a fraction of the
cost of traditional methods.

CSI introduces a market-changing process that applies open source
methodologies to building collaboratively developed software.

` `_

Facebook is a social utility that helps more than 900 million people
around the world communicate more efficiently with their friends,
family and coworkers.

The site has been built on common open source software such as Linux,
Apache, MySQL and PHP, and over the past few years the company has
developed a number of open source infrastructure technologies to
support the website's growth including HipHop for PHP, Cassandra,
Hive, Scribe and Thrift. Facebook engineers actively contribute and
participate in various open source projects, especially around the
Apache Hadoop ecosystem, developing technologies that facilitate the
sharing of information through the social graph.


Silver Sponsors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



The Linux Foundation promotes, protects and standardizes Linux.

To achieve these tasks, the foundation provides legal services to
Linux developers, collaborates on the Linux Standards Base, hosts
events for the Linux community and represents Linux in the press.


Bronze Sponsors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



ActiveState creates and provides industry-recognized tools and
professional business solutions for corporations and developers who
use dynamic languages.

ActiveState's open source language distributions − ActivePerl,
ActivePython and ActiveTcl − are renowned for their quality and relied
upon by companies and developers worldwide.



CiviCRM is an open source and free-for-download constituent
relationship management solution.

CiviCRM is web-based, open source, internationalized and designed
specifically to meet the needs of advocacy, nonprofit and non-
governmental groups. Integration with both Drupal and Joomla! content
management systems offers the tools to connect, communicate with and
activate your supporters and constituents.



IBM has contributed to projects hosted at the Open Source Lab by
donating hardware resources and through financial contributions.

IBM has long been an advocate, sponsor and contributor to the Linux
developer community and Open Technology development. Continuing this
tradition of support, IBM has contributed a number of POWER7 servers
to the OSL for the purpose of Linux and open source project
development by the community on the Power Architecture. Please see:
`http://osuosl.org/services/powerdev`_ for more information and SSH-
based remote access to Linux on POWER servers.
