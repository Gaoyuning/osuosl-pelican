Students
--------



Students are an integral part of the Oregon State University Open
Source Lab. Students are highly involved in all our development and
hosting activities, working in developer and system administrator
positions.


`Student Stories`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



Working on open source projects not only gives our students a great
opportunity to use, understand and contribute to new technologies, but
also puts their work out in the open where it can be seen and
appreciated by users, developers and potential employers. For an idea
of some of the projects OSL student employees have worked on, check
out our `student stories`_.


`Open Source on Campus`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The OSU Open Source Lab is not the only location on campus where
students are exposed to open source software and practices. The `Open
Source Education Lab`_ and `Linux User Group`_ are both very active on
campus and give students the opportunity to interact with other like-
minded individuals, learn new things and display the benefits of open
source to the campus community and beyond. Students also use open
source as part of the computer science curriculum, from digging into
Linux source for an operating systems class to learning about
communities, submitting patches and more in Tim Budd's open source
elective course. By working with open source at Oregon State
University, students are able to learn skills that will benefit them
greatly in their careers. To learn more, please see `Open Source at
OSU`_.


Work Experience
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Working at the OSU Open Source Lab provides students with an excellent
opportunity to gain work experience. These are not your typical
student positions. Students work closely with our customers and hosted
clients to provide professional development and hosting services. Ever
wanted to work closely with developers from some of the most prominent
open source projects in the world? The OSU Open Source Lab provides a
unique opportunity for students to do just that.
