About
-----

The Open Source Lab is a nonprofit organization working for the
advancement of open source technologies.

The lab, in partnership with the School of Electrical Engineering and
Computer Science at Oregon State University, provides hosting for more
than 160 projects, including those of worldwide leaders like the
Apache Software Foundation, the Linux Foundation and Drupal. Together,
the OSLâ€™s hosted sites deliver nearly 430 terabytes of information to
people around the world every month. The most active organization of
its kind, the OSL offers world-class hosting services, professional
software development and on-the-ground training for promising students
interested in open source management and programming.



By enabling innovative projects and distributing software to millions
of users globally, the lab is working to accelerate the growth of
high-impact open source software projects and promote an open source
culture of accessibility and increased productivity around the world.
The lab partners with industry leaders and policy makers to bring open
source technologies to new sectors, including education, health and
government.

Under the school of EECS, the OSL and the `Oregon State Business
Solutions Group`_ have joined together to create the `Center for
Applied Systems and Software `_ (CASS). CASS provides clients with
services for every stage of a project: designing, developing, testing
and hosting. This partnership allows each group to maintain its unique
brand while combining their expertise and giving them the ability and
resources to take on bigger and better projects.

To learn more about obtaining services from the lab and explore our
active projects, please visit our `Hosting`_ and `Development`_ pages.
A list of our hosted projects can be found on our `Hosted
Communities`_ page. To get updates on the Open Source Lab, read our
`Blog`_ page. If you are interested in contributing to the success of
our projects or sponsoring our students' progress, please visit our
