Government Open Source Conference
---------------------------------



The `Government Open Source Conference`_ was produced and hosted by
Oregon State University’s Open Source Lab (OSL) as part of its mission
to educate and build community from 2005-2011.

In 2005 a Public Sector program was established within the OSL to
educate and share information amongst governmental organizations and
other public sector institutions. While many highly technical events
exist for developers, system administrators and other technical staff,
no adequate source of information or event existed which was designed
for information technology management and the staff they rely on to
evaluate, plan and resource, and oversee implementation of enterprise-
class technology solutions. The nonprofit GOSCON was established in
October of 2005 as a platform for education, information and
collaboration.



In 2008, GOSCON expanded its program to include the international
community and conducted the First Annual `Open Information and
Communications Technology (ICT) Summit`_. The Summit focused on
national, regional and local government initiatives, projects, and
policies and hosted participants in Portland and via videoconferencing
from five continents. The “Global Dialogue on the Impact of Open
Source Software in Transforming Government” segment was produced in
collaboration with the World Bank Group Global ICT. Representation
included Brazil, Senegal, Russia, Belgium, Sri Lanka and Washington
D.C. with representation at the Portland, Oregon site from Ireland,
Japan and the US. Participation included organizations such as
OpenForum Europe and Japan’s OSS Open Lab.

By its sixth year, GOSCON helped to fuel the adoption of open source
technology in the public sector by attracting IT leaders worldwide to
its annual event. Conference content included lessons learned in the
development and integration of open source solutions into agency
environments, exposure to projects and existing software applications
and services, and opportunities to establish and foster relationships
for collaboration around shared interests. Industry luminaries and
pioneers gathered, presented and networked from public and private
sectors in a non-commercial setting. The last GOSCON took place in
2011 in Washington D.C.

There are currently no plans in place to reinstate GOSCON. If you
