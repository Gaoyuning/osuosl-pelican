Services
--------



`Hosting Services`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`The OSL provides world-class hosting services for the Linux operating
system, the Apache Software Foundation, the Drupal content management
system and `_`more than 150 other leading open source communities`_.

We understand that every open source project has different hosting
needs. We work with each project we host to meet those needs and to
create an infrastructure that will grow along with the project. `Read
more about our hosting services`_.


`Development Services`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The OSL develops technology and tools to expand and manage growing
open source software projects. Our talented development staff and
students provide a full range of development services including
requirements analysis, design, coding and testing.

We are passionate about developing a robust solution that is well
designed, does what you want and will hold up over time. `Read more
about our development services.`_


`Supercell`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Supercell is an on-demand virtualization and continuous integration
resource from the OSL. We have created this cluster for use by open
source projects that need to run software tests regularly but may not
have access to the appropriate hardware or the funds to pay for
outsourcing this service. Supercell allows projects to do manual
testing to verify that a submitted patch has actually fixed the
intended bug or to determine that their software package runs
correctly on a particular operating system or distribution. The
service also allows projects to test their software in a large cluster
using several VMs concurrently. `Read more about our Supercell testing
hosting services.`_


`PowerLinux Development Hosting`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The OSL partners with `IBM`_ to host `POWER7`_-based servers, making
partitions available to the open source community. Community members
can use these POWER7 servers to develop and test open source projects
on the Power architecture platform and in a PowerLinux environment.
These systems are intended for functional development and testing
work, but are not to be used for performance testing. `Read more about
our PowerLinux development hosting services.`_
