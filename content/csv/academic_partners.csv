"University of Alberta and Universidade de Campinas", "The goal is to
investigate the use of the speculation support in POWER8 for the speeding up the
sequential execution of programs. Single-threaded speculation has been used in
the past, through trace-based compilation. The goal of this project is to
investigate multi-threaded speculation of alternative paths of execution in a
sequential execution.

This is a joint project between University of Alberta (UofA) and Universidade de
Campinas (Unicamp)."

userspace library.

"Harvey Mudd College", "Observationally Cooperative Multithreading (OCM)
provides a ""kinder gentler"" form of concurrency, allowing programmers to
imagine that a single thread runs on the machine at any one time. With POWER8
hardware transactional memory, it becomes possible to actually run multiple
threads at the same time while *appearing* to be running only one at a time."
