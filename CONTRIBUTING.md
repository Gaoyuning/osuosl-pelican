Contributing
============

* Setup and get dev environment running as described in README
* Content for the website is in reStructured Text format which means that it is
  a collection of plain text files which have special markers to tell how to
  present any piece of text(or image or anything else that goes on a webpage). 
  You can use [this guide](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html) to
  understand how ReST format works.
* Styling is managed in a [different repository](https://github.com/osuosl/dougfir-pelican-theme)
* To add/edit content begin by looking at files inside _content_ directory. The
  _template_ file inside that directory is also a good template to start with!
